Aka Anonymous the beast	1	October 28, 2020	It's such a boring game it takes Soo much time to build a building in proper manner and there are so many bugs also included in the game such as stoping of construction in between and plays there are no good features included in it as well
S0UL & S0UND	1	October 28, 2020	I got in and saw the dragon, then the game crashed I tried again, same thing. That and idk why y'all insist on false advertising, cuz it's nothing like the ads

K.AARIFASHAN 007	1	October 29, 2020	Worst
Joannie Morgan	3	October 29, 2020	Really cute game, don't change a thing, love that its simulation, please don't add fighting or potions, or you would be the same as dravonvalle and a hundred other dragon games, you are unique, stay that way
Wu Qing	5	October 29, 2020	very nice game
Amanda Smith	4	October 29, 2020	Over all great game...
hinata hyuuga	5	October 29, 2020	So far the game is adorable! Cannot wait for full release.
Tiara Bonner	5	October 29, 2020	Very good game keep it up
Simon Gabriel Ursu	2	October 29, 2020	Absolutely nothing special to this game, there are plenty of other games exactly like it. Same pay to play stuff. There was not need for a new one of the like.
Carina Munch	5	October 29, 2020	rigtig fedt spil
OLHA ROMANIUK	5	October 29, 2020	Dis are kute game )))
MistrezzLia	4	October 30, 2020	Mix of Farmville, Zombie Castaways, and Wonder Merge all in one. Thoroughly enjoying it I just wish energy restored faster or there were more ways to get it. Once you're out of energy and all your machines are producing there is nothing else to do but wait.
Muhammad Makda	5	October 30, 2020	I love this game when I saw it I think what will be it date
Brogan Haddgh. 11	5	October 30, 2020	could be faster however I like this game 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Shattered Hands	1	October 30, 2020	There should be a way to restart your progress
Snezana Sipraga	3	October 30, 2020	I like the game but I hate energy games, can you rebalance energy rewords? I would like to play more than 2 minute. I will give you 5 stars rating if you fix it this issue.
Matt K	1	October 30, 2020	Seems to be a fun game, but the multitude of giant blinking yellow arrows makes the game unstable. They go off game freezes, every fifth one crashes the game. Plus so annoying to have the same stuff over and over pointed out. Can't play more than a few minutes before I crash. Too bad otherwise would be at least a 4 star game.
Sherry Armstrong	5	October 30, 2020	I love this cute game . Gave 5 stars, only thing I dont like is having to use Facebook to get the sign in stuff there are some of us that don't use Facebook at all. I use the google play to save game . If offer game should have same save game thing for it as well . Don't like being forced to get Facebook. Just as bad as the oculus rift thing
KZ Ni	5	October 30, 2020	ထခလ
Melissa Yadao	3	October 30, 2020	It's engaging at first but it gets kind of boring and repetitive after a while
Marissa Jularbal	5	October 30, 2020	What a nice game but the problem is lag and its ghraphics is low but always update it so that it will be improved
Tina Summers	5	October 30, 2020	Good , BUT it would be better if it would quit stopping !!!!
Brittany Smotherman	5	October 31, 2020	I love it
cindy viada	5	October 31, 2020	I love doing these type of games this game is really fun cant stop
pineapple wolf UwU	5	October 31, 2020	It's a really good game
Nicole Drees	4	October 31, 2020	The game is nice enough but SO incredibly sloooow. You wait till your energy is full, chop a tree, and repeat. The start is fast but after that it falls off really fast to snails pace Edit after response: I hope the game will improve, because it is actually fun to do a game like this for relaxation purposes. Keep up the good work!
Susan Dobbins cole	5	October 31, 2020	I love discovering the new dragons and clearing the land to see what is there to discover next
B. Knicely	3	October 31, 2020	Good casual game but there's room for improvement. Energy takes too long to replenish considering it takes a lot of energy to do land clearing. There are other ways to gather extra energy but once again the usage rate makes it useless. Quest are kinda all over the place and production times are longer than necessary. Between the energy issue and production there's no way to continuously play. Graphics aren't bad but the fixed screen makes it hard to get to certain areas on the map.
antoinette Stone	3	October 31, 2020	I like the game but it keep freeze up while I am playing the game but it's still fun to play when it don't freeze up.
Cassandra Mae	5	October 31, 2020	Wow great game! So glad that I pre registered! There is always so much to do, and it's like you took different aspects of games that I like and put them together in one game! Love it! 💖🎉
Annie Redmond	1	October 31, 2020	Looks fun. But cant even play because it keeps popping up no internet connection when I have wifi and full bars of data. I reload and then cant play anything till I try to restart. Then happens again. Please fix I wanna play!
Kay Hodgson	4	October 31, 2020	I usually don't enjoy energy driven games but am finding this game engrossing. It combines several facets of farming/exploring formats and, most importantly, offers enough options to get more energy so it doesn't bottleneck quickly like most energy dependent games. Good job, developers!
Vicky Hall	2	October 31, 2020	I enjoyed the game except that I didn't understand how to play it. I didn't understand how to get more diamonds to get products to continue to advance in the game.
Ryan Haider	5	October 31, 2020	Good
Crystal Miles	1	October 31, 2020	App keeps closing when half way loaded. Can't play.
Laty Karim	5	October 31, 2020	Best game ever
Shelia Cardinal	5	October 31, 2020	Great
yosepha anggie	4	October 31, 2020	This is a good game, i think i always need more more and more energy🥺 also it take a long loading. Pls do something make it perfect. Thankyou
Leeanne Wilson	2	October 31, 2020	The game won't load
Janet Chiasson	1	October 31, 2020	Can't get back in!!! Upgrade your servers!!!
Olta Plaku	1	October 31, 2020	Download it, tried 3 times just to open it and started playing. 2 seconds was okay and than it stopped working because they say no internet connection but I have a strong wi-fi connection at home. Tried again, the same thing so uninstalled. Not worthed to install.
Angela Woods	2	October 31, 2020	The game will not load tells me no internet gets frustrating
Jessica Chiu	5	November 1, 2020	Cool

Santy Tamstil	5	November 1, 2020	Thank you for your feedback. Love the game..n keep it up!!!
Janine Steyn	1	November 1, 2020	If I go into game it makes like white blocks on game and I can not ply plz plz fix it
Tracy Hogan	2	November 1, 2020	Long loading times and many instances of not loading. It's fun when you can get in, but it's often not working (this is just after getting notified in game that they took care of issues, but were not clear on what issues) time games are often wrought with problems
Kelley Hartman	3	November 1, 2020	"It's a fun game, unfortunately energy replenishes way too slowly. I hate when games dictate how long I can play at one time and with this game, it's not a long enough time for me to be ""into"" it enough to want to spend money on it."
Susannah Stearns	5	November 1, 2020	Good game, seems to game more activity pretty quickly. Nice graphics too.
Angel Taylor	5	November 1, 2020	Love the game. Now that they fixed my issue.
Valentine M	1	November 1, 2020	Beautiful game but you can only play for 1 min at a time because the entire game consists of clearing objects using a limited supply of energy. So you play for 1 min then wait an hour or more to refill energy to play another minute. Again beautiful game but I cant enjoy unless I dump what looks like hundreds of micro purchases to enjoy. Rather save the space on my phone.
Bernadine Wedgie	5	November 1, 2020	A lot of fun. Would love to play hours, but energy runs out quickly.
Michele Wells	5	November 1, 2020	Hooked

Shaez Nova	5	November 1, 2020	I am in love with this game! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Desma Britton	5	November 1, 2020	Very Enjoyable , This is a funblittle game. Ive played a few games sort of similar, butvthis game is far more enjoyable. The crafting is funer. The market system more balanced for your lvl. Still difficult to get energy, but not enough to make it feel like p2p.
Ericson Pamilar	5	November 1, 2020	offline games😍
Nur Adreanna	5	November 1, 2020	+graphics was awesome. Quite an interesting gameplay. But, 3 things. 1. The gems : wish it was easier to gain. Maybe a mini games or ads..or perhaps a cave of gems. That players can go there and mine for gems. 2. Life lines... The energy takes quite a long time to renew. 3. The progress of the games are quite eye catching except for the bombs that begins with 30 gems for a piece of bomb. Can you lower down the price for items that using gemstones? Overall I'm loving this game very much.
yvonne bell	5	November 1, 2020	Enjoying game. Can be slower if not spending money but still a good game
reo lynn	3	November 1, 2020	I would give this game 5 stars but u run out of lives way to fast so you cant play long
Elizabeth Race	2	November 1, 2020	It flickers on the Game

Salvatore Badagliacca	3	November 2, 2020	Good
Karen Zwyghuizen	5	November 2, 2020	Very fun game
Amanda Gray	4	November 2, 2020	I enjoy the mix of farming, crafting, merging, and exploring. I also like the fact that there are multiple ways for you to get more energy so there's no need to make a purchase if you don't want to. The special Halloween event is super fun and I can't wait to see what other events might be down the road. It does get a little slow once you reach a higher level, but I don't really mind waiting for my energy to replenish.
Jacki Furer	4	November 2, 2020	Gorgeous graphics.. can make your own energy to keep you in the game..I like being able to play for hours.. always something to do.. love the dragon slots.. so far my favorite game.. glad I found it..keep up the great work.. the bonus Halloween game a bit tough but you have the option of not wasting your energy.. love the crafting aspect.. wait times not to bad so far.. wish gems were a little more frequently given out or a bonus game would be nice.. definitely recommend
ANA Ecart	4	November 2, 2020	Is ok until now.
Kent Felix Tanamal	4	November 2, 2020	So far i enjoy play the game, the character have good expression. Why i give only 4 star because i know this game can still be improve some bug that i having like everytime i try to plant on all spot sometime some did not get plant, Its not big a deal but well kinda anoying. And i enjoy all the type of dragon in the game
Deborah Clark	4	November 2, 2020	Its a fun game has some glitches but if we're fixed it would be better it always has to reload or says internet connection is bad
George Schneese Schneese	5	November 2, 2020	Nice
Hope Mccullough	2	November 2, 2020	The game wont let me advance past level 3. It keeps telling me ive reached level 4 but my level doesnt change
Rahul Raju	5	November 2, 2020	Just in one word dreamworld

Kara Angel	5	November 3, 2020	Dean Angel Winchesters ducks
Noelle M	1	November 3, 2020	This game has a few issue's a fox that cost 300 energy to move so you can complete a quest to move on, the energy takes ages to build up that 300 is way out there to get.
JD Drees	4	November 3, 2020	Could be better about energy.
SPICEX	3	November 3, 2020	just started play this game, very nice.... give us some video ads to get energy and coins / gems and gifts. do this and you all gonna get lots of players on this game.
Jennifer Dyko	3	November 3, 2020	You don't give enough energy to complete anything. Good game, but you need more free energy available to the player.
Lessie Baker	4	November 3, 2020	This game is great but it keeps shuttinging me out
Mechelle Broaddus	5	November 3, 2020	Absolutely love this game! Is is so cute and is a nice change from the same game formats that I have played.
Robin Bouton	5	November 3, 2020	Cute characters! I am enjoying the story 😊
Shane McCain	4	November 3, 2020	Ok the game so far is amazing but....the amount of energy you have is very very bad. But overall so far the game is fin other than the energy
Kathy Mazzocco	2	November 3, 2020	Boring, you can't earn enough energy to get anything accomplished.
Jacqueline Reilly	5	November 3, 2020	Fun game, I like the builder part and adventure explorer parts are great. It's easy to gather chocolate, berries to gather energy.
Susie Callihan	5	November 3, 2020	Fun and cute graphics
Sierra Lewis	4	November 3, 2020	Its fun to relax
Fishing.momma Ison	4	November 3, 2020	Fun and cute dragons. Needs better energy earnings due to high cost of energy to clear an area, but a cute fun and sweet game.
Anna Vida	5	November 3, 2020	Good

Kira Andewiel	1	November 4, 2020	Can't even get the game to start. Downloaded it, tried to start it and got to load screen for it to half load and then it would just close down. Tried several times. Well RIP
New One	5	November 4, 2020	I love it
Beth Ewers	5	November 4, 2020	I love it
Patty Kitts	5	November 4, 2020	Great game
sukar banat	2	November 4, 2020	This cute game, and cute drawing also nice story, the thing that i really disliked the energy is too small till i cant enjoy the game at all, that's why i uninstalled it
mush	3	November 4, 2020	i was really enjoying the game but it keeps force closing while trying to open it back up. it's like I can only play it once every 24 hours and then it won't work again until the next day or two. I've tried restarting the phone I've tried clearing cache
Alya Fenume	4	November 4, 2020	Very cute, addictive, but... The energy is an issue. If you gained more energy (or faster) itd be great. Or! Even removing the cap from what you can earn idly while not in game ( say its 60 currently - but I'm off it for 10 hours for work. Coming back to 400 energy (by the 90 sec for 1 free) would be better) Super cute. I keep playing. But playing free will soon be too much effort/time
Lori Baird	5	November 4, 2020	Very fun game
Michelle Watkins	5	November 4, 2020	I love this game because i love dragons
Karen Peters	1	November 4, 2020	Not a lot of things you can do, takes way too long to be able to deliver any goods; gets boring do the same thing over and over.
Michelle Bartholomew	1	November 4, 2020	I was enjoying this game until today when I click on it it closes that I can't even play.
Tammy Brown	5	November 4, 2020	Fun and addictive
Kim Memmel	5	November 4, 2020	It's different but fun.
thant zin	5	November 4, 2020	Like
Maria K	1	November 4, 2020	CAN'T ENTER THE GAME!!! It keeps crashing.....
Susan Evans	5	November 4, 2020	Love it
Christy Waltman	5	November 4, 2020	Love
Sarah Groothedde	5	November 4, 2020	Colorful fun interactive well paced game.
Precious Dawn	5	November 4, 2020	I love the game from the farming to the dragons to making your own energy to building things exploring the only thing that I would ask to be different is so that we can invite friends and view our friends as farms and help them out so that they can send gifts and stuff overall like I love the app like I love the game I love playing it just wish I could share the experience with my friends and stuff
L Brooks	3	November 4, 2020	So far so good, it just takes more to upgrade dragons to full size
Cheryl Jacques	4	November 4, 2020	Ok so I stuck it out and played the game a bit longer so I'm editing my previous two star review. Although I still feel that the energy issue is a problem, you actually can get places. You need to calculate directions and choose the best possible route in order to save energy. It really does need to be adjusted tho by the developers to make it a little more fun for the players. Pretty limited on how long you can play each day without spending alot of cash. At any rate the game is super cute!
Khushi Rai	5	November 4, 2020	Good...
bernadette adkins	4	November 4, 2020	Wish energy lasted longer
Ciarra Miller	5	November 5, 2020	Keeps me entertained 😀
Juliet Ngozi Andrew	5	November 5, 2020	Incredible
Pankaj Patel	1	November 5, 2020	Pfff one more energy game...
Pamela Beldyga	5	November 5, 2020	Absolutely addictive
Adeusi Marvelous	5	November 5, 2020	Cool
Christina Benevento	5	November 5, 2020	So far this is a great game, tropical, water front atmosphere, adorable mascots, plenty of tasks to keep busy, and food!!! So long as playing doesnt break the bank and energy, buildings, dragons, ect. are all easily obtained with not just cash but strategy and patients, this game has potential to create quite a following. Great job techs!!!
Koko Moore	1	November 5, 2020	The ratio for energy gained to energy spent is WAY off... You can only play for a minute or two tops before having to close game to regain energy... To clear one thing takes most your energy... This could have been a fun game but its simply too tedious to only play a minute or two every hour...
Sandra Jensen	5	November 5, 2020	It's hard having to wait for the energy to build back up but the game is really fun and cute in two days I was up to level 14.
Jalayne Lindberg	5	November 5, 2020	Love it.🤩🤩🤩
Sarah Webb	1	November 5, 2020	I downloaded this game today and am still yet to play as it will not load at all
Paige Woodard	5	November 5, 2020	This game has great graphics, a decent flow of energy that also includes options to earn more. Crops are reasonable to grow and harvest is easily done. Love the never-ending storage!
Stephanie Doiron	2	November 5, 2020	Game looked like fun but too glitchy for me. Every 30 seconds or so, it disconnected from my internet and I'd have to close it out and restart the game.
JODIE-LYNNE GINDL	5	November 5, 2020	I love the cute little dargons in the game
Kathy Knight	5	November 5, 2020	Cute game lots to do
Heather Leigh	2	November 5, 2020	Not enough energy to get the things done that u need u chop down 2 trees or stones and your out of energy that fast takes days and weeks to get anywhere in the game
Shadow Proxy	5	November 5, 2020	Great game so much fun 😍👍
Ade Setyowati	2	November 5, 2020	The trees only gaves you 1 fruit and it takes a long hours to produce. Yet you still needs to wait for the dragon to awake. Nananana.... so yeah,I'll just wait how long is my patients with this game before I remove it And the never ending saga with the energy
Merz Ramirez	5	November 5, 2020	amazing😁

Sierra Chittenden	3	November 6, 2020	"It's fine. The art is pretty cute! Once you hit that inevitable wall after ""tutorial"" phase, it really slows down and doesn't feel so lively anymore. It's a colorful time waster."
Patty Demaria	1	November 6, 2020	Won't load
Shakoka Jacks	4	November 6, 2020	Very fun! I love everything about the game except for the lack of energy you can get or that you might have.
beckysaf	1	November 6, 2020	Keeps closing.
carol cintron o	4	November 6, 2020	Fun and cute...my complete is that when you have to go in the cloud. How do you pick up..the item.
Eve Connor	4	November 6, 2020	Ok so here is the best review money cant buy. I watched a commercial, thought eh thats interesting. Found out i thoroughly enjoyed it. Kept playing coming back as soon as the energy charged. I loved it so much, i had to unistall it so i didnt break my bank acount buying jewels. 2 improvements would be making watching commercials worth it. Not just 2 energy for a commercial. Secondly please either have the second dragon house has 2 rest spots or uses less sleep time. Not worth 80 jewels as is.
Debbie Jackson	5	November 6, 2020	Fun, addicting game!
Donita Vaughn	5	November 6, 2020	Awesome App!

Jose Pabon	5	November 6, 2020	It's really an awesome game all the different islands you got to go through and the adventures it's pretty good
Diane Smith	2	November 6, 2020	For some reason game companies think making the players pay real money or waiting hours for energy to restore is a good idea. IT'S NOT!! I have already uninstalled & will not be back. None of my other merge games make me pay $$.
Elizabeth Kirkpatrick	5	November 6, 2020	I am having fun playing this game. It's easy and relaxing.
Angela Garcia	5	November 6, 2020	This is a fun game. Im enjoying it very much.

Lisa Edmondson	5	November 7, 2020	I'm absolutely loving this game !great graphics and so many things to do to keep you busy...
Paloma Oliveira	4	November 7, 2020	I've been playing this game since it came out, and I'm addicted to it, but I have a complaint. The energy takes too long to fill up. One minute and a half is too long. And the fact that it has a limit and it can't add more and more energy as time passes by, this is a huge problem for me. Energy is the most necessary thing in this game. So please, it should be plentiful. I'm sure that if it is, more people will spend money on it. I know I would.
Nancy Stokes-parker	4	November 7, 2020	i love love love this game

RODOLFO FERNANDEZ	5	November 7, 2020	Entertaining
Michelle Vinson	3	November 7, 2020	Fun but, gets pretty tedious after a bit. I played for maybe 4 or 5 days, so many different buildings to build so that you can craft items and each building only has 2 slots open at a time unless you have enough gems to open more spaces.
Kai Bautista	5	November 7, 2020	I liked it. First time playing and it got me excited to explore more. Will keep playing this. Tnx
Gary Perkins	5	November 7, 2020	Good app
M Manese	4	November 7, 2020	I just started with the game and it delights me so far. Though I can see the energy consumption issue noted by the other reviewers this early. Will amend the review if I decide to play longer! 💛

Debbie Trigwell	5	November 7, 2020	I lov this game there is so much to do and it keeps u coming back for more
Emily Williams	2	November 7, 2020	Was a lot of fun, up until fire island. You're only in the game for 30 seconds because all your energy it's used doing one thing. And the foxes, that's a joke: the earlier islands, you'd spin and get 75 or 100 energy, by fire island, you'd spin and get 25-35 nearly every single time. The game became a bank breaker real quick. If you're looking for a cute game, it's definitely a winner, but only download and play for the first couple islands - then uninstall and move on.
Shawna V	5	November 8, 2020	Awesome. Fun.addicting game
Dragon Gex	5	November 8, 2020	i love it

Tawnya Sanders	2	November 11, 2020	Cute game but it gets ridiculous with how little energy you receive as opposed to how much you spend. The only way to enjoy the game is obviously to spend real money. Uninstalling. I am sick and tired of being nickle and dimed to death by everything these days.

Nicolette Reed	1	November 11, 2020	Horrible I downloaded the game and tried to open it and it wouldn't open for me to play, it would close before allowing he to play or it would stop working before the loading screen pops on so I uninstalled the game because it's pointless in trying to open the game app to attempt to play.. worthless game if you can't play

Lil Billy	1	November 11, 2020	"Another massive pay to play game, you hit a pay wall early in the game. They are very stingy with resources, you run out real fast, even when you follow the story. I only tried it to get a reward for another game but this game isn't free to play friendly. There are much friendlier games out there like "" family island "", uninstalling"

Emma McSweeney	4	November 13, 2020	I really liked this game. It just doesn't have enough energy to do but a few things.
April Willett	5	November 13, 2020	So much fun. I love dragons and this game gives me my fix lol
Jenny Yeo	5	November 13, 2020	Nice game and nice graphics
Jennifer Kordoba	5	November 14, 2020	I love this game it is avengers and you can get more dragons you need to get this game 😁
Janice Lemons	5	November 14, 2020	Excellent 😊😊😊
Joshua Havens	5	November 14, 2020	Good game
Angie Tribble	3	November 14, 2020	Not bad. They tried to combine a merging game with a farming game. But the nice thing about merging games is that if you merge five of something you get two. That doesn't happen here. The nice thing about farming games is if you're 30 seconds away from completion you can get the item early. That's not happening here either. I'm at level 18 and my maximum energy is only 67. I'm tired of waiting around for my energy to get filled up. I do like the slot machine
Natasha Acosta	3	November 14, 2020	The game's a good time killer but then again, this does have some flaws in it. The main situation is the lost of energy from collecting items and the amounts of low resources that you need to complete orders with. It's a bummer that you have to use real money on stuff like gems and energy tho it's also agonizing just to wait hours till that small amount of energy is used again then you have to keep waiting till it's refilled once more. The game's okay but waiting for hours on low energy isn't.

Lucas Strong	5	November 3, 2020	Very rewarding to progress. The game is challenging with real chances for failure that mean something. It doesn't hold your hand or ask every milestone for your money. A refreshing game that breaks the mold of other mobile games.
Jimmy Bolin	3	November 3, 2020	The sliding all over the place is bad otherwise it is a good game
Haide Wandaga	1	November 3, 2020	you should have indicated the exceed limit on how many are we able to build like for instance is the garden. I have crafted 5 garden but lately realized am only allowed 2 to build. WHAT'S that? WASTE OF RESOURCES!
Radioactive Ninja	1	November 3, 2020	Rigged raiding system. Beginner solo player or two player teams get matched with fully maxed player squads and it becomes impossible to defend. You will lose all your stuff in no time. It was my mistake spending any money on this game. The staff of Wrath that I bought, the level 2 backpack, everything was stolen. Don't spend money on this game.
Deno Afriyan	5	November 3, 2020	Great open world game, craft and survival, this game should be more appreciate, nice works on this game, keep doing the best kefir!
james burke	1	November 3, 2020	All of a sudden since the latest forced update I cant log in to play. It's stuck in an infinite initialization loading screen.
El Max	5	November 3, 2020	Buenardo
Richard Porter	4	November 3, 2020	I like it. Waiting to try multi-player. Should be fun. Will update after experience.
Cathie Glover	3	November 3, 2020	This was great until the first death. In losing all your items, you never catch up again. It takes forever to collect enough items to make anything as it is. Only once was I able to collect any of the items I dropped on death. I give up. I'm not grinding for hours just to get enough armor to be able to advance through the game.
Devin Nelson	1	November 3, 2020	You should fix the raid system!! I can't tell you the gut punch feeling you get when you spend 3 solid days grinding and completing the quests when all of the sudden (while smelting a 20 stack of iron ore) a raid begins on my base?! Before you know it, P2P Merlin strolls in, kicks the door down, one ZAP! I'm dead, revive after 6 sec with complimentary sword and shield, ZAP!, dead, revive, ZAP! Dead, revive.... He's gone.. 3 days of work are gone with him.. Now i dont even want to play.. :(
R B	2	November 3, 2020	Been playing for a few days and I'd guess its not a bad game for paid players, but its definitely not a game for F2P players as theres a lot of player killing/looting, even at low level, thats un avoidable as pvp areas are part of the main missions pretty early on. I understand they need to make money, but as a player that couldnt afford packs i was literally just playing the part of treasure chest for those that could.
SpaidX [LT]	2	November 3, 2020	Game it self is awesome. But when first raid came in got totally out matched by stronger people and lost everything...
Testepoi	4	November 3, 2020	I love the way the game works but I am getting a bug that from like 5-10 minutes it disconects me and its not my wifi cause its working pretty well with my other apps so pls see about it
Haji Ferreras	5	November 3, 2020	Excellent, no auto battle, no auto questing, no auto pathing. This is great, and even it has auto looting that is kind of nice. Great job
Alex Lo	1	November 3, 2020	straight up boring
Leng Almetodymel	2	November 3, 2020	Poor connection from server, its so laggy...
Bikramjit Dey	5	November 3, 2020	Oooo OK but my one issue I start this game from level 1
Efentisis Efenty	5	November 3, 2020	Im a big fun of kefir
Paduka	5	November 3, 2020	Best game
frank rodgers	5	November 3, 2020	Great game
Renz kristoffer Robles	4	November 3, 2020	Good game but there is some bugs but if you update the game and add more weapon and places for us to travel it will be good and increase the raid time and decrease the family finding time and i will give 5 stars😊😊😊
Art Macali	2	November 3, 2020	The game is good because it has no energy to consume great and unique games to be played but it can't opened in data mode please fixed this because it is a goodgame
Reji Thomas	5	November 3, 2020	It's superbb nice game !!😛
Stephen B Tupacisthebest	1	November 3, 2020	OK same as all kiefer games nothing special about it
cod mobile with friends	5	November 3, 2020	Lot of fun
Chad Duane	5	November 3, 2020	if you like watching Vikings this is the game for you
Harshit Shaw	4	November 3, 2020	Thanks for fixing bugs 😊. It is one of the best game I have played but there were many glitch I think the glitch will be solved now
Lingam	1	November 3, 2020	Draging of items from backpack to chests or clan chests is not avialiable .automatically closes the backpack. Could not drag any item to workbench or any..
Aulia Rizqi	5	November 3, 2020	It's a must played games bro! Trust me!
e X c e S s	3	November 3, 2020	I've given it 3 stars cause of some major bugs and glitches am facing. Plz fix all those and I'll give It 5 star. I've played Last day on earth and am really impressed to say that this game is far better than that but still fix all the remaining bugs and glitches
It'sNotJustice ItJustIs	1	November 3, 2020	You lose everything when you die including what you paid real money for. The game hesitates on tougher opponents. They call this survival but when it's set up to make you die so they can profit from it, it's more like robbery and that's exactly what it is.
Jico Zacarias	3	November 3, 2020	how to account
xzfallenangelzx	2	November 3, 2020	I have a problem when i die all of my armor and weapons disapear when i retrieve my stuff thats nothing but resources and throwables
Jesse Bennett	5	November 3, 2020	Very enjoyable so far. Easy controls and smooth game play. Similar to other survival type games with some different twists. Waiting to see what future updates will bring.
Shreedhar Nair	4	November 3, 2020	Pls make this interesting not like last day on earth And good luck to you all
Martínez Santana Ángel Abraham	5	November 3, 2020	The best game ever
Magma Syntax	2	November 3, 2020	Play the game without spending money first for some time. If you still like the concept then spend money. I really liked the game and bought higher tier backpacks and highest level weapons, but the game decided to match me (solo) up with TEAMS of high level players. They showed up and killed me (impossible to defend) and took everything. Hours of gameplay and everything I bought is gone in seconds. The game favors people with extremely deep pockets and not someone who can spend 10$ like me.
Nathan Zamora	3	November 3, 2020	Very good game I quit once my family members left :(
Alex Chioveanu	2	November 3, 2020	To create items, you need certain elements you find hard. Weapons and gear brake extremely easy. U die, u lose 50% durability of your gear. Die 2, its gone. And start again farm...farm...
Jorgia Rouise Flores	1	November 3, 2020	I have to delete the game driving crazy lose everything everytime someone kill me. bye
Crit Rocket	3	November 3, 2020	It's a good game but it's optimized rather badly, a lot of things feel far too clunky, mainly the UI, and there's far too many loading screens and unlocking animations that get in the way of actual gameplay.
Shawn Hazlett	3	November 3, 2020	Internet connection keeps failing and yes i have a strong signal im right next to the box please fix im really enjoyinh this game...
Kidaklungbe Pame	1	November 3, 2020	Wth the hell i cant even download😫
Karen M	3	November 3, 2020	Pros: u can go back and retrieve your items, unless someone looted it. No energy system. You can actually play with ppl instead of always against them. Cons: durability SUCKS!! even higher gear breaks on a single map because there's just that many mobs.
Aniukwu Caleb	5	November 3, 2020	Am addicted already
Anonymous Mofiz The	3	November 3, 2020	Fix server client connection. I keep getting disconnected and fix chat glitches. Please
[EXC] Miky Lito Fernando	5	November 3, 2020	Yo kefir i think u guys should make earning silvers much easier
Josh Yoder	5	November 3, 2020	As good as the last 2 survivals
Ali	2	November 3, 2020	i can't open the game. stuck on first loading. is this available for some regions? i can't even play with vpn edit: no there is a performance issues. i tried japan vpn and i can access the game now, but ping is bad, really bad ...
Fleeting Dream	1	November 3, 2020	If your a SOLO player dont play the game your just making other players rich with your items.
Mr Red's Gaming	5	November 3, 2020	Hey kefir! I really liked your games! I play it every time im playing this with my dad but my only problem is my mim wants to play with us but the thing is shes in ios and we couldn't find Frostborn in the appstore pls answer...
MOHAMMAD bargharary	5	November 3, 2020	Cool game
Joey FF TROLLER	5	November 3, 2020	Best online game ever made 😁 (in Android)
Aman Singh	5	November 3, 2020	No the server lost problem is still there please do something about it I can't even play it every time is just say server connection lost
angelo fuentecilla	5	November 3, 2020	epic. the best game ever.
Canada Account	3	November 3, 2020	I am a player of ldoe and grim soul for 2 years now and downloaded frostborn on global release again. The gameplay is good the pvp in zones is okay and there is a lot to do for now. I am level 26 and I played frostborn before when it came out on the first release. I quit because of the raids. Since that time it has actually evolved and become better.I know this game is pvp and that is the intention but i play solo and I think the raid system shouldn't be forced.F2P players have a hard time.
Nilotpal Gogoi	3	November 3, 2020	Made it 5 star to 3 star after playing for few days cuz it lacked sense of progress and very few areas. Thought it would unlock few new things after lv50, but all it did was less sense. Need to keep your bag almost full cuz its not enough even for 1 tomb to loot. Only numeric progress is hp 100 to 140 from lv 1 to lv50. Ow, once you cut a 2nd tier tree others have to wait for hours cuz there only 1 area with that 1 tree which have to be shared with 500k players.
Robert San Miguel	5	November 3, 2020	This is the closest a game can get to Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons. I would gladly throw money at it if it releases more content and customizations.
Richard Greblo	1	November 3, 2020	UPDATE: After 2 updates still cant get in the game... cant pass the initialising screen (Looked forward to playing this game, but couldn't even get in the game it's just stuck on initializing for the past hour)
Isaiah Monroe	5	November 3, 2020	I like it so far i don't like how chat doesn't work or really get the family system but still fun to craft your place.
AMIRUL MUSTAQIM BIN ABDULLAH	1	November 3, 2020	dont play the game, its just another money hunger game like kefir other games.
Ryan L	5	November 3, 2020	Game is amazing and very fun. Teaming up helps out a lot but can also be dangerous. Cant put this game down since i started. I only have one request, can you make a buyable backpack that we get to keep when we die. Not the contents, just the larger space.
Dean Overton	5	November 3, 2020	I have been waiting along time for Kefir to bring this game to Europe as I was unable to play it. Now it has released I am finally able to play, and I must say, the game environment is amazing, the controls are easy, and the viking theme of the game is fantastic.
hi how are ya	5	November 3, 2020	just so good, definitely an improvement that should be strived for in mobile survival games
Jason oliver Metcalfe	4	November 3, 2020	Very taxing on your devices battery. Even when on charge.... Device heats up alot. Game play machanics are similar to previous Kefir! Games love the new feel and am super glad there travel time to places is nice and short. It means you can actually play the game a on the for a good couple of hours. Love the idea to be able to play co-op .. all i need to do now is find some friends ...
tidpogi	5	November 3, 2020	Great game!
Jeremy Weghorst	4	November 3, 2020	Fun so far. But one major thing I would change right away is adding item descriptions when you select an item. Its been annoying trying to figure out what stuff is and what its for. Is this leather or bacon? Can I equip this or is this a crafting material? Can I use this to recover health or what is it? I pick stuff up and I have no idea what it is without trial and error.
B D	5	November 3, 2020	I love it
Mr. Black	5	November 3, 2020	I love the game very fun to play how about you guys make the stable easier to make and add a pet dog like Idoe it woud be interesting thank you
Muhammad Daffa Muzaky	1	November 3, 2020	I stuck in loading screen,i can't play
Ashley Stevens	5	November 3, 2020	Great fun love the survival side of things but I dont like the monster hitting you when your far away pisses me off
Durjoy Kumar Das	5	November 3, 2020	Best survival game i have ever played. I like this game very much.
Zackery Bruce	5	November 4, 2020	Have played games like this one before but this is far better than the others i have played i recomend that everyone should play this game and good job to those that have created the game
Rachel M	1	November 4, 2020	This game has potential. BUT after losing all the progress I made over the last few days, TWICE, I unistalled. I logged out and when I went back my house was gone, the materials I collected, gone. Everything, gone.
Cj Douglas	5	November 4, 2020	Best game ever freaking love it been playing two day so addicted.
Death God	1	November 4, 2020	Doesn't work on data
Parthib Koley	3	November 4, 2020	Everything is good but there is no way to send text messages to other players. There is no send button in the chatbox, it's impossible to send a text. Please fix this as soon as possible
bazzaar23 YT	5	November 4, 2020	Mickey mouse is hot
Dale Redd	5	November 4, 2020	nice game!! love it!
Mr. Owlz	2	November 4, 2020	The loading screen literally takes 3 minutes to load.. and when you're exploring to a specific place and your experience server lag the next thing you know is that you are dead... that's why I'll give this game to star for because of the server lag bug that can kill you what i mean by server lag is your character just suddenly take over the control then start teleporting to random locations on the map that you are in and the next thing you know you've been killed by a hostile mob
zarko vujkovic	3	November 4, 2020	Game looks and plays great but the equipment damages too quick. I bought a pack including some armor, one quest and its gone. You can repair items but only one at a time and it takes 24hours??!!!! Per item!!!! So one quest and you have to wait 4 days before you can play again... so stupid! And the fact that I paid for it makes me even more salty.
Neil McKinney	5	November 4, 2020	Awesome updates. The grapics are better than previous, love the chat feature now no problems. Amazing weapons and classes to choose from. All around it is a great game. Maybe one day we will be able to tame pets or do a clan vs clan resource challenge. Or see which clan can deal most damage to a boss in certain amount of time. Keep up the good work. Love Frostborn
Bob Kevlar	1	November 4, 2020	Couldnt even connect to play so... 1 star, lmao
Fenil Kheni	5	November 4, 2020	Hey kefir a tiny but wayy more important-for-me request 🙏🙏:- can you please please remove those snacks that run out from bushes I played this amazing game just for a day, only to realize I can't control it... I have a high degree Ophiophobia(condition where you a totally sacred of snacks) I am not able to sleep today cz everytime that thing run out of bushes I flinched and okay... It was fun initially, but now it's just one day and I can't sleep, I am uninstalling the game, but will keep an ey
Сардор Зайнутдинов	5	November 4, 2020	Great a game
Adham Nagy	5	November 4, 2020	Nice
Robert W	5	November 4, 2020	Amazing game, love the fact you get unlimited gaming time, no need to wait for energy to refill, defibarely looking forward to playing this more
vikyath shetty	5	November 4, 2020	Thanks for help me out in my problem This is a best game
Mahdi Abbas	3	November 4, 2020	Pros: 1- great game 2- beautiful graphics and soundtracks cons: 1- server issues sometime 2- weapens and armors breaks extremely fast
Valentino Ceaser	4	November 4, 2020	Still having troubles with the bugs I want to to enjoy this Great game but it's glitchy
Egīls Pērkons	1	November 4, 2020	I have sent a message to support, no answer...
David Delgado	5	November 4, 2020	First survival game ive ever tried and am loving it.
toufi kou	5	November 4, 2020	best survival game ever
Joey Underwood	5	November 4, 2020	Fun time killer
Leah Alfonso	3	November 4, 2020	It's an ok game. There are a lot of objects you need to advance that are a little ridiculous to get. If something is necessary to level up, at least make it something you can craft. It's just a typical money trap. That and the fact that you die and all your stuff is gone. I've played games that don't do that and it's one of the biggest things that will make me uninstall a game.
Kevin thegamer	1	November 4, 2020	This game needs work , I'm non pay2win and as soon as my rare weapon breaks I cannot get even to the top 5 of tournaments and after I recovered after about 10 losses I get fully raided by a 400 power guy wearing full epick gear this game is fully pay2win I went to a different reigion, got wiped by a team doing a raid , lost all my stuff again And a third time this game is so goddam pay2win its annoying
The Fallen	5	November 4, 2020	Definitely the Game is too good! Especially for people who played Last day on earth before will love it! It's very Happy to see all the things Needed in Last day on earth is given in Frostborn with the Addition of Norse Mythology!!! Looking forward for Future Updates!!
Serveladik	1	November 4, 2020	Тупой типичный рескин для бабла
LorenzZ C.	5	November 4, 2020	Great
Fliberdijibit777	5	November 4, 2020	Best top down survival game 2020 hands down ever!! If u play survival games this is on your list!!!
Nicholaus Cosmas	3	November 4, 2020	I rate it a 3 because its a unique survival game kinda remind me of durango...but i will rate you more stars if u fix the fact that weapons and armor get deatroyed pretty soon and early and please it would be more great if you add up a dodge function to help escaping enemy attacks. Put that into consideration
Adam Meese	5	November 4, 2020	Perfect game to grind out on either solo or with friends. Easy connection, easy linking up and running dungeons, plenty of loot and random events. No problems with this game at all. Now if you excuse me, I have more grinding to do.
Tony Hardy	2	November 4, 2020	Good look to it, but weapons and eqiupment dont last very long and you die really fast. So its a endless game of collecting stuff over and over. And you always have to worry about ppl raiding ur base and taking EVERYTHING! Then u have to start over. I dont see the game lasting for long.
Cory Zapf	5	November 4, 2020	Very good specially the energy that u dont have to use anymore great job
Royal Fox	5	November 4, 2020	I played Kefir's games for a long time. And I am a fan of there work. They are very grindy game, so if you dont like that, this is not the game for you. But it does have you enjoy other things such as buiding a villige. (Bunch of AIs). and there is also the multiplayer part of it. This time they actully made it online. In this game, it has friend co-op. But if you do not have any. There is also random familys/clans. Just dont die, it will break your will to play.
Fiofan Chernishoff	5	November 4, 2020	This is one of the best types of those rpgs where you survive and kill other players at certain LV.
Khue Nguyen	5	November 4, 2020	Love the game so far, lot of challenges, the pvp matching is not very good though since you can encounter heavy pay to play players alot even though you're not
Socrates Santos	5	November 4, 2020	It's hard but makes sense, awesome!
Micheal Harmon	5	November 4, 2020	Great so far one of the most unique games I've seen on Google play smooth interface and a variety of choices between classes is a great game for all RPG lovers
igal nagar	5	November 4, 2020	Great game
Tendra Calrissian	4	November 4, 2020	The main problem I have with all survival games is that weapons, even metal ones, wear out way too fast. If you would increase the durability of weapons and armor, this game would be much more enjoyable. It is quite good in other respects, and I will continue to play and see where the game goes.
Flame Stardragon	1	November 4, 2020	Raid is unbalanced you can forcefully put in to it
Curtis Baskin	5	November 4, 2020	Not bad its so far pretty good on explaining what to do
Ang Yee Feng	5	November 4, 2020	Good game but very hard if want to play solo, nice graphic but your sneak button is a little bit smaller than ldoe. This is a PvP game ,I don't know but maybe the p2p players will make this game to p2w ,hope it won't be but this game worthwhile to have a try. In conclusion ,total f2p will live very hard in this game😂 if you don't have very active teammates.In my opinion ,ldoe is better tho(for f2p)
Gabriel Guerrero	5	November 4, 2020	Best game ever
Athar rr	5	November 4, 2020	i havent played but im sure itll be good
reymar mirando	5	November 4, 2020	A really good game entertaining great graphics great concept
chad smith	1	November 4, 2020	No connection every 50 seconds fix this then 5 stars. Uninstalled.
Aarav Charak	5	November 4, 2020	Its soooo goood game, i like it a lot everything seems good expect one thing developers plz make the durbality of a weapon more cause if its hard to craft after a use few times it likely to be broke and it hard to craft, so plz make the durbality system more effective
Sumit Bhopali	4	November 4, 2020	Your team make good games I have been an last day on earth player for over a year and now this game is lit 🔥 to but the character need to run faster I mean it's animation or not but it's kinda weird to play after playing lode.. Update it and fix it please🙏. 😁✌
Dieter De Necker	5	November 4, 2020	Best mobile survival in google play, I have played Grim soul dark fantasy survival and its not as good......Love this although there are some changes needed like a sprint option because if you can sneak you must be able to sprint aswell and I have made a purchase and havnt recieved it so please help me there???
Ronnel Fontbuena	5	November 4, 2020	i liked it
cali gamer	2	November 4, 2020	Bruh doesent give the rpg nor survival feelung nor the viking one slowly downgrading to garbage is just stuff break quick and u gotta prepare 2 days for 2 minutes so no i dont like it stop wasting games
Denise Parks-Woodstock	5	November 4, 2020	I really like this game. Once I figured it out.
Zul Rafiuddin	2	November 4, 2020	Connection lost. It seems you lost connection to the game server. Please, restart the game.. Please help this issue :( I already restart it, but its still the same
mama ZED	3	November 4, 2020	Dont play were slow
Luige Lagumbay	5	November 4, 2020	I like it
balogun adura	3	November 4, 2020	I made a mistake and I want to lose game progress and start all over, but it's not working. What should I do
Isham Rozani	1	November 4, 2020	I like the concept of this game. What I don't like is the premium account. Player with premium account can get very rare (OP) weapon. Yes that mean it's pay to win game. Albion Online is better than this game.
Sedrich Carbonell	5	November 4, 2020	Amazing
Mark Caesar Olidan	3	November 4, 2020	Pls fix the bug and lag of the game.. But overall it is a nice game...
Pouya Khalili	3	November 4, 2020	I was really excited to play this game but it's not working
Seth Emerson	1	November 4, 2020	Great concept but once again no point in palying guys. Its pure p2w you can buy anything and everything to make sure you can never die.pointless in my opinion its not survival if you can just spend money on the best gear and shelters. But was cool tell you see that down the line when you get to lvl5 and up with pvp ereas and content free players will be wiped and leave game and the whales will have no one to raid and you know whales they dont kill there own kind so you will have a dead game :)
KATIKA ALLABAKASH	1	November 4, 2020	This game is not bad but it makes me fustate at some parts of it.1st is the weapons and armor are wearing too fast.And 2nd one is the time of the repair table it takes 24 HOURS TIME for repairing of weapons.even it take same time for common and very rare things.ITS SO FRUSTATING AND SOO REDICULOUS
Yung King	1	November 4, 2020	"Hi yea, remove the pay to win armors and houses because it RUINS the sense of work ans value. And from the start ive had NO shield of protection I want my things to be safe if I havent engaged in PvP. (Edit: I see KEFIR has a record of responding yet saying NOTHING of substance lol. They say ""we understand you're mad, please just forget it and stay"" scumbags."
Ashton Lai	4	November 4, 2020	The game is very very good but I got glitch out of my world and into a blank dark world. I can't re enter my world I keeps spawning me out said of it how u can fix it.
Inag Somar	3	November 4, 2020	The game is fine at first but after i purchased savings pack, the game freezes a lot. Not worth the money
sugar gold belvis	1	November 4, 2020	Always disconnection problem, other players are complaining about it already and devs are not doing anything about it
Logan Matthews	4	November 4, 2020	Really good game
Shouma JP	1	November 4, 2020	Honestly, the mechanics of the game isn't that great. At least make the Tomb or the events time longer for me to get back to my stuff and get the heck out but no, no it doesn't have that kind of mechanics.
Jericho Padasas	2	November 4, 2020	When you get raided by Playes nothing well left in your chest and thats the time to quit the Game,You spend much time on farming and Upgrading but when get you raided goodbye to your Hardwork
Yee Shan Lau	1	November 4, 2020	The game is good but there isn't any explanation on what's going on, item descriptions and other things ... This could be a great game if they have provided a clean guidelines and instructions
Michael Ho	1	November 4, 2020	Don't play this game unless you are a hardcore gamer with harscore friends. We played for 2days addicted farming resources. We lost everything suddenly after getting raided. No notification or anything. I went in the game, I was in a raid (I didn't accept or anything) 3players attacked me. 3v1 took everything from me. All players significantly stronger than me ( a lot damn stronger ) How does this make sense? The game doesn't tell or teach you anything about the mechanics either.
killerclaw 2862	5	November 4, 2020	Great game.
Salve Marie Dorato	5	November 4, 2020	Great game! I love that we can build our camp! It's like the crusader game i've played when i was young. It's a really engaging. I like it!
GrayKage	5	November 4, 2020	awesome gameplay
JACK REAPER ff	4	November 4, 2020	Beeeeeeeest
Drukk ray	5	November 4, 2020	I'm really happy with the play flow to timer ratio. It's a solid game, and it's still in development.
Alvin Jimer	1	November 4, 2020	i wanted to restart the game progress because i was stuck on the quest on crafting a backpack there was no animal to hunt anywhere. i disconnected my Google account cleared the game data. then reconnected another Google account but it still loads the previous character. uninstalled.
Unit 5	1	November 4, 2020	The Raiding system is broken we got matched with 4 Purple geared player's and lost we thought it was gonna match us to someone that has the same strength no we got matched with someone much stronger there 4 Lvl 50 above and were only 3 mostly lower that 40 we havent even unlocked raiding tools yet and they have those raiding equipment Unfair and the sanctum of odin is so hard to get items from why the enemies have 3~6× health and getting pendants its so hard its Not even worth playing it anymore
Xrhstos Papadopoulos	5	November 5, 2020	Excellent i like it so far, can't wait for what's coming next!
Heavens Gate	1	November 5, 2020	Help me please i always get disconnected even i got the highiest speed connection how the heck im going to play this game? i tried to search the problem even vpn but still disconnect whats wrong with your connection OMG.
Bossgelo Gaming	5	November 5, 2020	Good...... its very nice and cool kind of games. its different and the system was easy to understand... It still on beta but you can enjoy it a lot... Tnx to kefir by making this kind of game... The ldoe is also one hell of a good game... Can you plss do that when we open a chest we can switch between the other chest...
Sreyan Roy	3	November 5, 2020	Nice game but the reason for 3 star is the same old problem of Kefir.... The Server Lag. Please fix it. It's really frustrating when one gets killed and loses resources due to lag. Enemies are not taking damages while I'm taking damage.
Surekha Kale	5	November 5, 2020	Amazing Ice Age survival game it's great
80's songs	5	November 5, 2020	Awesome
Anwar Wu	5	November 5, 2020	Great game, very addictive especially when playing with a partner or a group of friends.
TwoStroke Tony	5	November 5, 2020	Ok now that the update has shown up im giving 5 stars u guys have done a great job updating this game so far keep up the good work. Edit: Just wanted u to know the acts quests dont autmatically complete if done before the quest comes up
The ATrain	1	November 5, 2020	Fix your servers!

fox zzzzz	5	November 5, 2020	the best game
Greg Luck	2	November 5, 2020	Just like all other semi open world survival game, good concept, nice graphic, bad execution. To enjoy the game you basically have to either invest money or invest lots of hours. Its not a game you could enjoy playing with friends, its a serious competitive game you have to spent hundreds of hour before you can feel the game. When you spent hundreds of hours it turns into a chore already.
Paul Toma	1	November 5, 2020	Playing for a half hour and a server that says low occupancy and been kicked off 9 times so basically every two minutes. Plz fix cause I like the game
Tactical Fox	5	November 5, 2020	What I love most about this game is the fact that there is no energy needed to travel from one place to another, from what I've encountered the game is not pay to win. It's very easy to get resources and survive but a bit harder to advance and get better. With constant future updates and a growing player base this game should get better. 9/10 would recommend
Jayden Dickson	5	November 5, 2020	It's great and better if your family dont do raids
time to watch	5	November 5, 2020	Such a amazing masterpiece its soooo good but a question: How to play melt player ?
Richard Hodson	5	November 5, 2020	Fun and easy dont have pay but dos make it more fun
Jonny Bravo	4	November 5, 2020	Awesome game just one thing is awfull,it doesn't matter what kinda weapons or armour you get it breaks so fast you won't even be able to enjoy it,very disappointing
Vahid Mustafazade	5	November 5, 2020	Everything is fine now. Thanks for the Support.
Jadyn Oxbrow	5	November 5, 2020	Awesome
Crispy [Swing]	5	November 5, 2020	Very good game
Gary Hambrick	5	November 5, 2020	Not a pay to play, well balanced, slow steady progression
Anonymous guy	1	November 5, 2020	Hi deleting the game because I cannot change my player name. Thanks
Kevin Tilton	5	November 5, 2020	It's a fun time killer!!...plus you can play with friends!
Nicholas Morrell	4	November 5, 2020	Great game, server performance can just be frustrating at times, especially when you log back in and it turns out while you lost connection you died and lost all your stuff. But tbh great game and concept when connection is working smoothly.
Gav Mil	5	November 5, 2020	Like last days on earth but faster pace, more crafting options, and class selection to give it the RPG/MMO vibe. Could just be personal preference but I love it.
Aaron Lopez	5	November 5, 2020	Amazing game
Tyriq Mullins	4	November 5, 2020	I loved it and it's great but here's some stuff u could add like sprinting and more classes to choose from at the begining the more the better and maybe add a bigger presence of magic
John Doe	2	November 5, 2020	G. Play required and connection was lost frequently. Unistalled.
Hope Ross	5	November 5, 2020	Very realistic looking game.
Cameron Jones	1	November 5, 2020	WORST GAME EVER I played this game for hours on end constantly dying to stupid reasons than I finally get stoked up a little bit so I try to play a raid ONLY TO GET INVADED KILLED AND GET EEEVVVVVVERRRYYYTHING STOLEN
aldrin cuenca	3	November 5, 2020	"The game is nice, played it for some time, but now im stuck on the title screen ""frostborn----co-op survival"" for some reason, no matter where i tapped it's just stuck there, title screen with black background, nothing else, not even loading. EDIT: it did work yesterday after an eternity of waiting without knowing if it is loading, now it kinda loaded faster from the title screen, took a minute or 2, just dunno why it gets stuck on the title screen even tho you guys have a proper loading screen"
AbdulAziz Hashim	5	November 5, 2020	It would be helpful, if, we could fix our items instead of waiting for it to get destroyed and craft new ones
francis perocho	5	November 5, 2020	Cool
Ozzy Oquias	2	November 5, 2020	I love the game very much but the only thing that makes me very very VERY mad is that it moves without animation and just got some weird adrenaline going on and I keep dying at the first attempt on green places and now I am very much barely holding to what will I say to you when I let it go and so fix the signal strength problem at Main Asia server and fix the lags because it still have some tiny lags on it and will you reduce the items for the stable at 25% because it's so hard finding stuff.
carl warior	5	November 5, 2020	Better than the other zombie game
Spicy Mc Haggis	1	November 5, 2020	I loved this game in all aspects until i learned u were kust after a ton of ptp like so many like u. I was growing great at level 20 i tryed to take on a low level dungeon that popped up near me i was slaughtered with no way to retrieve my body or the weapons i worked to build....thats when we all learned that u stand no chance just being a solid player but it forces u to buy to stand a chance.. .sad part is i do pay for alot in games but not when u design it to get u literally nowhere without
Chan Ho Nam	5	November 5, 2020	Great game!
Jim Kelley	5	November 5, 2020	I enjoy it. Well done!
Josh Faner	4	November 5, 2020	Need to make more space for the bag and chest
Feral Cyborg Gaming	4	November 5, 2020	Still getting into the game. Good so far.
C.D •	5	November 5, 2020	I can play it all day
arthur maciel	5	November 5, 2020	Very good spin in this game type having classes and a very well though and well made coop system making the game in a very great position .
Kotom Kid	5	November 5, 2020	It's a really good game i needed but i have one problem i think if iam in the camp i can craft things with my materials in the boxs and thx for the great game🥺🥺👍
CONRADO AGBUYA	1	November 5, 2020	All controls wont function, big waste of time, BIG FAT BS GAME
Royal Gaming	4	November 5, 2020	I personally love the game its co op, its fun, it exciting but i kinda wish there were more unique events and more content but other than that i wouldve gave it a 5 but overall its one of my favorite games ever and i cant wait to see where this game takes off towards and if possible sometime make the map bigger
SFPDL GAMING	5	November 5, 2020	It was a very fun game to play this. But one thing wasn't really was those hackers and its not fair. Can you pls add a repeair bench
Miguel Zapanta	3	November 5, 2020	"The game was satisfying for a new release, having it to be a coop. survival makes it much more interesting. Yet today as I was going through my items a problem occur. ""Every item in my vault was gone"", Please help me. (I have discovered recently that my vault had restarted and all my items have been removed. I knew it due to the letter/scroll in the beginning of the game as you enter the vault.) Please do look into it, I would be very greatful if I could get the items I stored in that vault."
John P Gerona	3	November 5, 2020	Game is fun but there some items that is not in game yet. I can only find a maple tree in a map and copper too. I think the next update they will improve the resources that needed for upgrading wall and other like stable. And armor and weapon is so quick to break and their is no plank in the game and others require items for making the armor and weapon into the lower of crafting. But I enjoy the I hope more improvement thank u
Rick Gi-Oh	2	November 5, 2020	This game seems to have an issue where its constantly losing contact with the server and when your trying to stay alive to save your items this makes the game impossible I mean its constantly reloading every minute literally sometimes even more than that. And it's not my internet it's your server contact. I'm sure your aware of this I'm still trying to play but it's not gonna last if this isn't fixed. Other than that o like the game alot. Please fix this. Beta testing is no excuse. Is it ready?
Jay Blackstone	3	November 5, 2020	Love the game but hate the raid feature! Been saving up materials, weapons and armor and someone raided and everything is gone now. Lost interest now as getting the materials is very repatatious and takes a long time, I'm done with it now as I don't want to waste hours and hours getting everything again
manu malik	4	November 5, 2020	I Like the game graphic gameplay but there is few problems. 1- family In starting I don't know what to do.after a time I create family but now no one can invite me because I am already in family I don't know how to exit form that. 2- some of the items have very low durability like armour few hits and gone. 3- some of the think r not easy to create I am not saying make so easy I hope you understand. 4- add option to upgrade all think at one's like walls and floors
Elijah Cooper	1	November 5, 2020	Login issue and server access issue after 2 days
Hatake Kakashi	1	November 5, 2020	Stupid servers (not an internet problem) can't login have to wait for 10-15 mins to login and than server kicks me out and the mobs resets and lost all my stuff...
King'Otter Gaming	5	November 5, 2020	good game
Bob Bib	5	November 5, 2020	Absolutely great game, gameplay is great, family function is great, discord community is great
Tommy Pietch	1	November 5, 2020	Dropped down to 1 star.... pay to win, Rich kids run in packs and demolish ur base even if ur not in a clan u get paired with full 4 man squads who raid u for everything u have. If the pairing was fair it would be great, but nope. Just a money grab...
Charles Sim	4	November 5, 2020	Good game but can you add more place to go adveturing
The Eggg	4	November 5, 2020	It's pretty decent game id say, it will be cool if add ability to dodge enemies attack by adding a rolling or striving button
Suhayb Suhayb	5	November 5, 2020	I would like if the adead an evade bottom
Privet Navernoe	3	November 5, 2020	Донат много чего решает:// поэтому это обычная донатная игрушка, как и ласт дей
Adan Santos	5	November 5, 2020	Since this is in early access stage, might as well say a pretty fair feedback. The game is good i give it that but in terms of items durability i gave it 3*. Like most of the feed back says the items wears off pretty fast maybe fix it a little bit, for ingredients i found the game lacking for raw hide and scrap which is a very needed item for most equipment, to fix it i suggest add more animal that produce hide. Another one is family and raid, instead of 4 members why not 10 maximum.
Mine Rock	4	November 5, 2020	Good game
Gurau Pedas	5	November 5, 2020	Cool game
Kito Isaac	5	November 5, 2020	I love this game so much, but please add some more this like quests,pets, and please fix the internet connection issues
Unknown Player	3	November 5, 2020	Kefir Please Fix The Bugs On The Game Because When I Build My Wall And When I Play In The Morning The Wall disapears Im Not Even Lag But I Like The Game Ive Been Waiting For this Game So Long But It Still Lacks Content
Uttam Ghosh	5	November 5, 2020	This game is great this game become my favorite in 3 days but please add some pets and some more monsters and enchantment table which help us to enchante our weapons to make it more powerful and add some ability thanks.
SmiechU	5	November 5, 2020	Very addicted, Very fun, nothing to argue with 😁
jenrae santos	5	November 5, 2020	It's a very good game but there is one thing I hate. the game always says connection lost even though I have very great wifi. I just wish they can fix server lag that is all
Among You	5	November 5, 2020	Good graphics and gameplay and good multiplayer game
Jay	1	November 5, 2020	Its engineered to spend money games like this should be band. 24hrs to repair 1 item?? Weapons last maybe 10 enemy's then vanish Like what kind of game is this avoid like the plague.
Bobby v	1	November 5, 2020	"I tried to play your game. I don't understand the problem here. The server is green. And it won't let me join. ""Update"" I've deleted the game and reinstall. Still can't play. Not going to waste my time. It looked interesting too. Oh well. There's more games out there 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️"
CLIFFORD PETALLAR	3	November 5, 2020	good game but you will die if you go to any dungeon you cannot exit immediately because of the timer. so you will end up dead unless you buy premium items.
Darrius York	5	November 5, 2020	Awesome game
David Wright	5	November 5, 2020	Good game much better than most
Kayes Khan	5	November 5, 2020	Liked it so much<3
NemesisJacob	5	November 5, 2020	Better than I thought it would be ☺️
Leroy Galindo	1	November 5, 2020	Waste of time.
Tosh Mccollum	5	November 5, 2020	please put in controller support
Deivid Jefferson	4	November 5, 2020	This game is better than the original game LDOE because it doesn't have any energy but the one that i hate from the game is you can meet other player and they will steal everything they steal my loot and everything like you must fighting over just for a tree/rocks
savage gaming 123	5	November 5, 2020	Its awsome i've always loved viking mythology so this game has answered my prayers
Chotu Pagi	1	November 5, 2020	Soo much lagging in every server , I can't continue my game , plz fix asian servers , I don't wanna change servers every single time to play.
Simon Gabriel Ursu	3	November 5, 2020	Too much pvp, survival in itself it's a hard struggle, but having a bunch of people running around and taking your resources and killing you or making your life harder, while others plunder your home, that will make people give up on this pretty game. Reduce the pvp, make more non pvp regions. It's like a battle royale out there, it defeats the purpose of a survival game. Oh, and we need classes that don't depend on a certain weapon. Also, what's with those lv99 players on new servers?
HickabXGamer	5	November 5, 2020	صلحوا اللاق، و صلحوا القلتشات. الباقي كله تمام
Random channel	5	November 5, 2020	SO LAGGY EDIT:NEVERMIND THIS GAME IS SO COOL I SUGGEST YOU TO PLAY IT
Antonio Samuels	5	November 5, 2020	So downloaded it yesterday. Its pretty awesome and really love the co-surival part awesome. This is really worth playing in your free time;). Eveb tho everyone say its cash grab it does make it fair for everyone like people like me that cannot buy stuff can win awesome weapon with ease to use. Definitely worth the stars :)
Patrick Delos Reyes	5	November 5, 2020	5 star. It's enjoyable and easy to play. Hope they add more good stuff in the future. And to future players i recommend joing the discord server
Call me Master	1	November 5, 2020	The direction control sucks.
ICENOVA	5	November 5, 2020	I'm so addicted to this game it's unbelievable Good choice was to release this game during covid cuz people are really bored
Jun Reforzado	2	November 5, 2020	How to delete or change your character?
Dino KF Wong	4	November 5, 2020	Better than most of the survival game. At least u don't need to constantly feed the thirst and hunger. I'm lvl 24 but still can only fight like a lvl 1 because fighting is not based on levels but on the equipments u have. Which the weapons and equipment wear off quite fast. Most zones are still red to me.
Oni-chan Gaming	4	November 5, 2020	I like Kefir Games its really enjoying butwhen you get died gg
doc.ro.k	5	November 5, 2020	So far so good, I'm at lvl25 and lvl25 district, the game is so much fun!
Robert Mihaly	1	November 5, 2020	The only way to repair, as far as I could see is to buy in cash shop repair station. I swallowed that and bought it, but now to repair a simple weapon takes 24 freakin hours?!? Or pay more for instant. F. Y. Sideways
Taiki Yamashita	1	November 5, 2020	the always needed to be restarted every time you go back and forth from one place in the map to another which is very very much frustrating.
Adovan Ginting	5	November 5, 2020	Please add trade feature
Umar Aziz	1	November 5, 2020	Pls fix again i cant open this app
Phil Carr	5	November 6, 2020	Awesome.
Nova Night	5	November 6, 2020	I love it, for this type of style game, this is the only game thatba played the longest.
Hello World	5	November 6, 2020	Super fun and new player frienly. Though perople can pay to win this game does a good job to ballence it. The devs listen to the player and actually make updates that help the players instead of their wallets making the game engoyable.
Trey Carter	5	November 6, 2020	I love this game but when I load into populated areas my game freezes or teleports me around the area in which cause me to died, I also think that there shouldn't be a limit to doors or the inability to place four walls on one floor
Jed Dequito	5	November 6, 2020	Good game.
REGANETH GAMING	5	November 6, 2020	This game is amazing but can please make same land for everyone in family or maybe add a system of having ur own area and a seperate family area and please increase item durability ... It feels like the stuff we crafting will be destroyed if we use it or add a option for dodging attacks manually like a rollback, slide or shield.
DILLIGENT GUARD	4	November 6, 2020	Again and again those events makes boring
arun Vennamalla	5	November 6, 2020	Very nice game very much time killer
Cameron Hall	5	November 6, 2020	Cool game!
Ionut Dinca	1	November 6, 2020	"Interesting game if it's not so limited by the ""premium"" subscription."
Paul Jamerson	1	November 6, 2020	50 hours worth of items gone in 20 min because a family of p2p players can buy their way to the top. Theres absolutely no chance for f2p players to thrive in this game. I will never come back to this game.
Izaiah Oler	4	November 6, 2020	This game is very good, very interesting. My only issue is the speed at which things break, and how costly items are to make. Please please please. For the sake of pvp or dungeons fix either or tweak it a little bit. Having the best staff in the game break 5 minutes after getting is a terrible feeling or waiting 24 hours for it to be repaired by the station? Just to use it for 5 more mintes and have to repeat. Please in the next update make a change to this mechanic. Other than that I love it
Ganbaatar Anar	5	November 6, 2020	💚💙💜🖤💚💙💜🖤💚💙💜🖤💚💙💜🖤
Eidans	5	November 6, 2020	so far is best survival i played. continue playing to see whats await later :)

hady anaste	5	November 6, 2020	Waw
P. Kris Knight	3	November 6, 2020	I prefer action games in first person. Nothing personal.
Martin Kolev	1	November 6, 2020	Got my first purple weapon and blue set of clothes. After killing some people my connection stopped and i died (the problem wasnt from my Internet). When i logged in again i was at home lost my lvl 2 bagpack my set of blue clothes and my one and only purple weapon (i have opened 2 wooden 2 silver and 2 gold chests and got 1 purple weapon AMAZING). Thanks for the lag, bugs and all of the other trash stuff! How can you not give a game like this 5 stars. SO GOOD!!!
Tessa Lynn	1	November 6, 2020	I really want to play but it won't connect. Can you please fix this?
alfred huish	5	November 6, 2020	My new favorite game!!!!
Danny Brown-Joy	5	November 6, 2020	Love it
atam atam	3	November 6, 2020	Best survival game for me so far. My opinion, if only you can make 1 map, we can build our family or region house in the same map, its the best survival game for me. Also can you make a map also can build houses or defence system and rare resource? And that map we must fight or defence it from other family and region. A special map for rare resorce and war.
LetsGoDeezy Music	1	November 6, 2020	Worst game ever you spend your money and a full geared team raids your home take everything free2steal ass game
Adrian Gustafson	5	November 6, 2020	Maybe have a way to expand your back pack and be able to have more of one items In each slot instead of 20 maybe 100 since its hard to keep up on your resources
Jhanber Miguel	5	November 6, 2020	I love this game just give it a little bit more multiplayer and more items and exploration its good
Maicol Rodriguez	5	November 6, 2020	One of the best game i Played in this category of games.
John Smith	4	November 6, 2020	Gj
Verslunarstjóri Bónusar	3	November 6, 2020	The game is a cool concept and all but I really don't like the durability system nor the 4 minutes to craft 1 plank aspect of the game. If they fix those 2 issues of mine anytime soon Ill come back to it.
Joshua Voyles	5	November 6, 2020	My son and I have tried Stormfall, grimsouls and several other survival games. So far I think this one has them all beat. I love the class system, running curer and decimating those zones with little cost. And then you see an upgraded level 3 wall cost and you cry a little. But thats part of the game. I am looking forward to seeing what they do with this game. Keep it up!
zul Zam	5	November 6, 2020	The best game
Shintarō Lin	5	November 6, 2020	Actually best survival game thats free!! Compared to all the rest yo cant complain even for the minor details!
aaron keener	5	November 6, 2020	Good game, wish resources respawn faster
Kuburan Dwi Panji	5	November 6, 2020	So far so good boss
Ramtin Mojibi	4	November 6, 2020	This is a nice hardcore and real tim mmorpg game if you don't have the patience or time to do things slow don't play this game. not recommended for busy people, highly recommended for hardcore mmorpg lovers Edit: the support team is awesome too
Carl Earegood	5	November 6, 2020	Fight, Farm, Build, Farm, Upgrade, Scout, Run, PVP, Die, Revenge, Micro Transactions, Build. Repeat.
Cory Jones	1	November 6, 2020	Too many negatives to list. All those 5 star reviews have got to be fake.
Kevin Harvath	3	November 6, 2020	This game is nothing new, repeat over and over again, past games your not really fighting real players in open world maps they are Ai. They make you think your playing against real players but it's not true... Repetitive waste of time. Loot loot loot , die die die, farm farm farm .. good time killer and well done for what it is
Austin Farnsworth	5	November 6, 2020	Love this game.
loren pioquinto	5	November 6, 2020	Best co op game, hioe theres a lot of updates and new features

Jawad amin	5	November 6, 2020	This is a good game
Matt To The Max	4	November 6, 2020	Thank you for finally making a game that doesn't force you to wait i like that i can actively play all day and no energy mechanics though my only issue being alot of the time i find it hard to find other active players also english active players my suggestions would be 1 translator for chat 2 bots when you can't find anyone to do a sanctum with OR lower difficulty option for if you need to solo a sanctum 3 avalibility dodge/block like a button or something anyway other than that perfect game.
Mark Leo Calalo	5	November 6, 2020	Magnificent!! I Love the new elements and mechanics of the game. Encountered a lot of disconnection. But still a good game. Thanks Developers
Nokia 3	4	November 6, 2020	This game is wonderful but can i ask for a new place like LDoE and i wish u read this
Catalin Chirea	5	November 6, 2020	I quite like it,but I'd like to change my controls more thats all and new weapons and armors btw
Sal No waY	5	November 6, 2020	👍
Alex	5	November 6, 2020	Better then LDOE
Jay	4	November 6, 2020	We need more doors :)
Shaunak Bhat	4	November 6, 2020	I am not able to delete my old account and I want to start a new account but im not able to other than that the game is amazing I love it the concept of it I really like it but I would appreciate it if you fixed that
Coffee Holic	3	November 6, 2020	"This is a great game in the making. First of all, thank you for not adding ""energy"" or ""stamina"" in the game. It's a huge difference from other games that require stamina to do anything all the time. The grind in this game is really good. I hope you'll implement a handbook or something where new players can check to see where they can gather a specific item. The lack of tutorials is also refreshing but can be overwhelming to players who are new to this kind of game."
Dinanto Prio Dharsono	5	November 6, 2020	"great game! but there""s still few bug inside"
Kisha Kesha	4	November 6, 2020	This is fun play with friends but the items of durability is sick..broken too fast. Like LDOE,you use items to get items and in the time goes by it will be bored just circling around.
Sam the Slayer	4	November 6, 2020	i played it its a very nice game but a little hard
Xaviervina Xaviervina	5	November 6, 2020	Good
N	5	November 6, 2020	It's fun playing it with a buddy were enjoying it quite a bit
Joven Perez	3	November 6, 2020	This game got a potential. I'm just kinda annoyed because i am always stucked only in loading screen. Always need to reconnect to enter th game then after awhile, when going to my camo, stuck again at loading screen. I dont have a problem on my internet connection and device used.
hamid hajimotallebi	5	November 6, 2020	Wooooooow
Robert Henry Gouck	5	November 6, 2020	Good game
Alex1 Encabo	1	November 6, 2020	From 2 start to 1 star, cool game like this should not be frustrating, i just made an axe to cut mapple tree, then theres these PK players killed me, then later i go back there, and still not reset? They are still there they killed me again..i know you know how hard to find nail if you dont have the table to make one, and mapple tree can only get in redzone, it so sucks.. its also hard to get axe for mapple tree.. Please add reset button for every area.. gosh.. cool game but frustrating.
Jath Garcia	3	November 6, 2020	Switching account in one device is not working. I hope there's other ways of logging in accounts, i dont feel secured in google play's save data. I think sometimes you might accidentally overwrite your game progress in another account and end up losing it. Having username and password is alot better.
bEr LiN	3	November 6, 2020	The gamplay i good and the graphics is great, however the real problem is it is hard to progress if the items are easy to break it doesnt last even though it should be, i just had 5 swords and shields just to finish an entire hord of enemies, whats more annoying is that the items are easy to break it does not last long, it is much weaker than a minecraft sword.
FREAK Y	5	November 6, 2020	I always sport u guys
anthony anderson	2	November 6, 2020	Meh, the game needs a lot of work. Workbench should be obtained before other crafting tables that require items made only at the workbench, family members shouldnt be aloud in your home without being let in, durability loss on weapons and armor need reduced, die twice all your gear is gone even if your fully repaired. The game does have some good qualities no energy for travel which is awesome, minus the workbench being available 30 levels after you need it other than that progression isn't bad
Zeen Darco	5	November 6, 2020	New game from Kefir gotta play it no matter what 😌 forever a fan
Azeem Shaikh	5	November 6, 2020	Updating my review now its work fine nd im enjoying the game ty
Sean Riddell	4	November 6, 2020	I absolutely love this game. But the creator put items you can build in the game but didn't put the needed ingredients to create it.
Helly Fire	1	November 6, 2020	Before okay and the best. But after sudenly dc and restart all my item gone and all my high lvl item that i buy just vanish. I teleport inside home. I use a real money to get that stuff. Sudenlly dc ..poff all gone..my 2 tier backpack my purple armour and weapon, my 5 bolas .. Come on kefir pls fix this.. i played your game since last day on earth first release.. 450 gold coin not cheap you know
C Barron	5	November 6, 2020	Its a fun survival game,
ElOliveiro	5	November 6, 2020	Grest
SinnerS NeVo	5	November 6, 2020	good game
gaming with coolboy4386	4	November 7, 2020	Everything things is good but as a new player i got killed in an instant by someone who has better weapons than me
Dærkñéßß GaminG	5	November 7, 2020	Nice
BM_Scy	1	November 7, 2020	Nice game but still I don't know at what point it will open.
zkie 123	5	November 7, 2020	Ilike the graphics and the game is good u can build family with friends
Vikas Goyal	2	November 7, 2020	Game graphics and control are good but not running properly in my mobile VERY DISSAPOINTED
Steven Hodges	5	November 7, 2020	Hands down the best survival game on play store. This game has great graphics, and you can build your on district not just a camp. Join a clan and your allies our right beside you to adventure with, trade, or gather. Nothing hard with your allies at your back. The game makes feel like you're not just surviving. It's a good quest and story driven game. I like how you can travel around and not have to worry about energy for travel, that's huge for a game like this. I highly recommend.
Vijay Pattani	5	November 7, 2020	Amazing 😍😍😍👍
kem Dalman	5	November 7, 2020	Good night
JoeJoeis awesome	5	November 7, 2020	I love this game
Hire Frost	5	November 7, 2020	Game's amazing, fun, and greatly suggest everyone to try out. 😊
Tom sam	3	November 7, 2020	Its co operative survival but doesnt give u a chance to add someone as a freind ...oh and u should be able to find bases customly(raid..instead of only picking randomly..u can maybe put in a family name and d person accepts)...thats all last thing is that the game is good no doubt
Enrique Laredo	5	November 7, 2020	Great game
Mark Jherard Valdez	5	November 7, 2020	I love it
Imhotep	1	November 7, 2020	Constant connection lost, yet other games work fine
terracleon	5	November 7, 2020	Awesome game honestly just dam well amazing the graphics for this game is just beautiful Love the mechanics for crafting and leveling up Along with the gathering system. The fact that all equipment items have durability is also cool. Thank you to the creaters for the creation of this game . And can't wait to see what this game will be like in the future
Jay Storey	5	November 7, 2020	I love this game...wont open on my phone anymore though and I am sad....2 stars sad. Replying to comments, I cant open the game at all on my device, thus I cannot hit the support button. Updated to 5 stars, working better than ever
Kheman Vikash3	1	November 7, 2020	This game is soo bad... I used class 1 to kill a class 3 instigator set guy(p2w) and another guy who spawns out of nowhere come and takes my loot which I spent a long time and a lot of my resources to kill him and exits in 5 secs without any problem . This game doesn't deserve a single star.Thats how u seriously reply nice game awesome don't play this game anyone. Best way to gamble ur money in this game
Dhruv Dev Singh Gujjar	4	November 7, 2020	4 stars because I like the Viking theme and other theme of the game I think the team doing a great work on this but I expect more from this game I think the team of developers should make this game more like the last on the earth in graphic and simplicity like that one also and no problem if it's sire became 500 mb or more we just want that graphic and animation . Hope you guys do that . However great work guys
Maliki New	5	November 7, 2020	So awesome its like last day
CosyMo Gaming	1	November 7, 2020	It's a fun game until you have to grind for hours and hours and hours, just to get one of the thing you need. But a fun game.
Darrius Johnson	1	November 7, 2020	Spent hundreds and put items in secure chest and log in and my chest was switched with someone else's that was clearly free to play have messaged in game support no reply been 2 days. Don't spent on this game as it has no support and lots of bugs. Thanks but have been waiting 4 days do not think they care they already have the money and said they will get back to me i ask for an update every 8 hrs and have been being ignored .
guest 666	5	November 7, 2020	starsnipe play it thats why I install it UWU
Douglas Farley	1	November 7, 2020	Game is unplayable in its current state. Enemies can hit you but you can't hit them back. Constant disconnects and lag. Uninstalled until game state is improved.
Mark Emil Bernardo	5	November 7, 2020	good game, hope for more updates and more features.
Trevor Soule	1	November 7, 2020	Sounded interesting but it's just a clash of clans clone
FRANCIS singha	5	November 7, 2020	Cool Awesome
AL- Yesul	5	November 7, 2020	Best Survival RPG Ever!
F J	5	November 7, 2020	Great job. Items a bit to pricey, but very good game.
king atwar	4	November 7, 2020	I love it but omg the grind to upgrade my walls is real
Alexander García	5	November 7, 2020	It's a Nice experience, but i would love if you could do an individual loot from monsters, or at least family-bounded. So your family members can have their own loot when you clear tombs.
Gummy Bear	5	November 7, 2020	Nice game
John Sharpelyuk	4	November 7, 2020	Pretty fun game it has a lot of potential and you can play with friends
Mx Souls	5	November 7, 2020	I played grimsoul and last day on earth a lot But this one is great!!! But i must use vpn so plz fix that :(
Massinissa Aberbache	3	November 7, 2020	The gameplay is awesome and the coop mode makes this game unique but I'm removing 2 stars because of the durability of items ... the durability of pretty much any thing in this game is a joke even the pickaxe and the hachet get broken too fast and this is a turn over for many players forcing you to spend a little bit to get started.
Michael Roman	4	November 7, 2020	I love it but i dont like certain glitches like one time we defeated a bigger boss and it didnt let us loot and no chest will open.
Mason Stone	5	November 7, 2020	im a lastday on earth fan this game by far is my favorite game it does how ever get annoying whene you keep diying but is simple and ez to play and get beter My favorite part about this game is ther is no energy you in my opinion this game is the best game kefir game has ever made
Wane Kawayne	5	November 7, 2020	This is a great game keep up the great work
Shawn Grimes	5	November 7, 2020	Its so cool
GreenBlazer 416	5	November 7, 2020	This game is phenomenal for a mobile game. It does experience a little lag on occasion but not bad. If you like games that require a lot of grindy farming for resources this game is great for you. Leveling up is fast and not very difficult. Free to play players have to grind extra hard (as would be expected) but its possible to play for free and alone. It is geared more for multiplayer co-op so expect it to be especially difficult if you decide to at it alone.
Richard Tsueda	4	November 7, 2020	Good
sonic gaming 96	5	November 7, 2020	The best game ever .
Cheye Daugherty	5	November 7, 2020	I like the concept and Gameplay
THE GAMING WOLF	5	November 7, 2020	This is an upgrade to ldoe gamplay wise anf everyrhing. Just wish it was optimized and is more relyable. The fact that there is real time pvp is amazing and i really look to seeing this game grow and develop more because this game helped me make mutiple new friends
Yaman Alwan	5	November 7, 2020	Best survival game ever . I like the idea that there's no energy so you can go wherever you want without spending time
Demonic	5	November 7, 2020	Bueno el gane facil
Ken Kopper	4	November 7, 2020	Almost perfect. A lot of grinding but it's about average. Not too hard to learn. The (NA) server has been down all day.
Christy Marcum	5	November 7, 2020	I've never played this game before but it seems to be a lot of fun thank you
Ryan Roseberry	5	November 7, 2020	I really love this game. The only downside is the grinding on trying to keep enough food or potions. Since there isn't an option to rest to restore health at your camp.
Jack Miller	5	November 7, 2020	Absolutely brilliant game though I find myself getting lost in and losing time. Way ahead of others like it.
tounsi blid	5	November 7, 2020	This is game very good
Drew Vollenweider	5	November 7, 2020	"So far so great! Before you roll your eyes and scroll by, yes, this game is an isometric, camp/wild areas, randomly run into other players in wild areas, game. But it is SO MUCH MORE. If you've also been a fan of these style games but grown tired of all of them being exactly the same, this is the one that finally did it right. You can join a ""family"" of four players and your personal camps are placed directly next to each other and you can visit as you please. There are raids, events, etc."
Amanda Holmes	3	November 7, 2020	I like this game, there's a few things that could b better. Movement is very slow, weapon duration poor also when leaving zones the 5 second count down b4 u can leave. If these were better my rating would b better. Its early days I am new 2 game.
telcosico111 bremer	5	November 7, 2020	Really good game
Norma Torres	4	November 7, 2020	Lost my stuff i had 20 gold pendents and i died then the server rebooted and update and lost my stuff from body but this is still a great game either way
FEARMAKER	5	November 7, 2020	FUN! I have played a few games like this one but the fact that they allow you to play the entire game co op is awesome. The fact that I can continually play the game whenever I want is nice I dont have to wait for a stupid 6hour timer for places to have more loot thats one thing about the other game is why I stopped playing. The pvp is rough at first but once you get the hang of it you can juke the higher levels and get your stuff. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun challenge.
Ryan Campbell	4	November 7, 2020	Weapons and gear degrade too quickly.
DJ Shakey	4	November 7, 2020	Very Good. We need a Clan HQ, where we can make alliances with other families. Do raids, trade and war others.
XxLegendaryAngeloxX Monte	5	November 7, 2020	The best game
Hunter Wain	5	November 7, 2020	This game is amazing definitely should play
Black Witchery	5	November 7, 2020	Absolutely brilliant. Thank you for developing a great coop survival/RPG. I would like to see more daily events, perhaps daily login rewards that include weapons and rare items. Surving red zones is very difficult and costly because of the TON of grinding needed to craft rare gear. Gold prices could be dropped a little as well. You'll have more people spend money of you include these things but all in all? Wonderful game. Thank you!
Kaleb	5	November 7, 2020	Its Amazing tho I don't like how you lose your stuff that was in the bag when you die
Marcus Johnson	5	November 7, 2020	Very good game
Veneric Alex	5	November 7, 2020	Great game... I wait for more updates. Good luck!
daniel hunter	5	November 7, 2020	1:the game is a map by map type game with no cost of travel (energy) to each map area unlike other games alike which i find good 5star 2:coop joining 4 players home map together is a great add on so you help each other in strategic building and defence 4star 3:crafting is simple but to unlock craft you have to upgrade a town instead of leveling up 4star 4:pvp on the pvp maps is good but ive came across a bug where i killed a player he returned and killed me i then returned and couldnt kill 4star
Snaps	5	November 7, 2020	Awesomeness!
Peter McKinley	5	November 7, 2020	Yeah...its better than any other games released by Kefir! I really enjoyed this game
David Rigsby	5	November 7, 2020	Fun
Eduard-Theodor Cioaba	3	November 7, 2020	Game was alright at first. I lost purple backpack and few weapons cuz of lag. Died and stuck in loading screen and couldn't log back in to get my items back...can you help me with this ?
Daniel Armstrong	4	November 7, 2020	Definitely one of the better survival style games.
Thompson Chua	5	November 7, 2020	This game is awesome
Anthony Asaibene	4	November 7, 2020	Great game! Still at a low level
RasBamboo Bridget	5	November 7, 2020	Learning experience
Loki	1	November 7, 2020	Rules state multiple accounts are not allowed so in turn with no way to know if two people in the same household are playing or if its just one person with several accounts. The game is limited to one person per household because you run the risk of both or all people playing if more then 2 getting banned from the game. This is unfair and also limits the severely limits player base with in turn means limited income.
Abel Duran	1	November 7, 2020	After the update this still hasn't fixed my issue of being able to play the game!
Triston Porter	4	November 7, 2020	This team stays updating their games, I've enjoyed them all (other than any play to destroy players) this game however makes co-op so much more accessible right away! It takes time to farm, and to get a well put together idea on how things should be, how to play, and overall nitty gritty to games like this.
Omda Parrots	4	November 7, 2020	Please write on each weapon's info the mastery points that it will give us on the donations so we can calculate it easier before we go... Also let the Family's leader open requirements like lvl and language and appear on search list so it will be much easier to make good family
Devan Wulf	3	November 7, 2020	I've played the 36 hrs straight I love this game if u made the tools and weapons have a little higher durability died give it a 5 star because I mean I feel like the sword and shield don't do much it's a waste of materials I mean they dont really block damage and the sword is kind of bad or make it so u can craft just shields and just swords
Alvaro Clavijo	5	November 7, 2020	It is a really good game very fun
Rick Klingensmith	5	November 7, 2020	Awesome game
hafiz uddin	5	November 7, 2020	Very good game...i like gameplay and support low device mobile
Monster	5	November 7, 2020	Love it too much
Mason Miller	2	November 7, 2020	It's stupid how someone can just take all the loot after you do the work buncah lazy people just stand back and then take your stuff kinda ruins it for me
Barron Tranate	5	November 7, 2020	I really love this game! Very well made and being able to give suggestions on the discord is very helpful!
Boon Chi Chi Towera	5	November 7, 2020	One of the best survival games there is.
Kento Konoe	5	November 7, 2020	Amazing
Charles Mccully	5	November 7, 2020	Love the game, love working with other players,needs work on weapons and tools,they break too easy,need fences for defence purposes,other than that I love the game
Ivan Fernando	3	November 7, 2020	loads forever trying to enter even the most basic zones
AG huner	5	November 7, 2020	It's vary good game just make more things guys or make something that you can make to have more guys on your family
Bryan Jeson	5	November 7, 2020	Edit: I'm satisfied
Jayleen Paneto	5	November 7, 2020	Second favorite game but should fix the graphics a bit.☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆
Aiden McNamara	5	November 7, 2020	Brilliant game charactors customisation home customisation and trades all is good bit of a grind at the beginning but defo worth it
Chillplay gaming	5	November 7, 2020	The game is great the game doesn't use energy and and I grind resources but the one thing is doors I can only build 20 and I thought it would be enough but when you have a big base you are going to need more doors to keep raiders away for your chests but overall it is a good game I like it hopefully the creators come up with more ideas
lilflyy 13	5	November 7, 2020	10 out of 10 best multiplayer game just had a update
Max Playback!	3	November 7, 2020	I love the game when it comes to survival and multiplayer and having a family is a bit hard bc they dont really seem to be online sometimes (Note: Thank You Kefir)
Hope Maestas	5	November 7, 2020	It is good
Sean Barker	1	November 7, 2020	Can't rate this app. It won't start game..I have done 2 upgrades and I am going to try again...I have motorola with Android 10 I now have downloaded the new update and it still won't let me play
ainnadrh	4	November 7, 2020	this game could be a very time killer but should add promo codes or whatsoever as a reward for players , internet issues even though my internet is good it still says reconnecting and also about the loading on the start of the game is taking too long maybe you can fix this problem and this game will be the best ;)
Tura De Seara	5	November 7, 2020	Everything you need is in this game 😉
Sark271	4	November 7, 2020	It's a fun game and good game but I wish there was a start over option.
John CampbellTattoos	4	November 7, 2020	Wonderful survivor gameplay. And a real mmo!

Xent bendal	5	November 7, 2020	Nice game
Ryan King	5	November 7, 2020	Love the game so far I haven't had any problems so far but what would really be nice is if the when you finish the tasks they go into you inbox and not your inventory
Aj	5	November 7, 2020	Really good love it
jones Songuitan	5	November 7, 2020	It is very challanging and fun because it is a multiplayer game.
Giar Saptahadi Pratama	4	November 7, 2020	After update, it takes more time to finish the loading screen. The Main Asia server is too crowded. Please make the loading faster.
The Ghost	5	November 7, 2020	the best game ever i love it thanks :)
Lecaine Tso	4	November 7, 2020	Smooth
عشاق اللغات	5	November 7, 2020	5 stars for the devs to keep their great work. But to be honest the game deserves 4 stars because of rarity of items. The idea of letting us play with friends is amazing, raiding rules surprised me tbh they're so fair and fun, however, the raiding tools require 1 week of grinding to fully raid one base because of how difficult it is to find the required resources to craft raiding tools so I hope the devs make it easier to raid since it's the most fun thing to do. Keep up the good work guys.✌️
Shido-san sishukai	1	November 7, 2020	Long loading time
Rexmond Fang	2	November 7, 2020	How do i reset the game. I left my phone running, when i came back i died a couple of times and lost all my beginner stuuf. Message your support nobreply
Aaron W	4	November 7, 2020	Pretty good. I think tools degrade a little fast and I think bandages should be quicker to get but overall I like it.
Cherryjane Capillo	4	November 7, 2020	This is a great game because i have to get rich im rich now
Apple plus Pen	4	November 7, 2020	Great
mohammed boudoubaz	4	November 7, 2020	The game give you a Viking experience in a survival way I like it so far I'm still at the beginning but this game is some how different from other survival games Good job
Babyboy	4	November 7, 2020	hey guys I'm Alex and I love everything about this game except the two problems for my character #1 I want my character to run and walk #2 I want this game to have a day and night theme if you guys can make those two happen I will give you guys a five star but everything else on this game is great
FreGz	5	November 7, 2020	This game is awesome
Ron Tot	3	November 7, 2020	I can't play the game again because the Update appeared suddenly but when I got in the Playstore, there is no saying to Update the game
Jhon Blackman	5	November 7, 2020	Noce graphics,no need energy's to travel, and add some events pllss...it so very good

BRUH	5	November 7, 2020	Incredible game and I know it's a rip off of Last day on earth but it has more features to your game. But I've been encountered several mentions that I have low connection but my wifi is strong. I know is still under development but may you fix that please?

Pocket Gamer FrenzyRagey	4	November 7, 2020	Best last day on Earth Gamestyle
Amirul Haikal	4	November 7, 2020	I'm quite like this game at first but, in my opinion the rage mode likely make someone who not turn it on could not defense himself from other player.
Luke Skywalker	5	November 7, 2020	Very fun game.
cyrus klay lingad	1	November 7, 2020	this is bad game becsuse its hard to get items
Laurentiu Muraru-Alexa	2	November 7, 2020	This is pretty good game ...my only problem with it is that during raids you get paired up with entire families as a solo player ....and you really don't stand a chance...if is a p2w one you will lose everything ...days or weeks worth of farming. I know is a co-op game but still give solo players a chance. Those solo zones worth 0 if you get raided by a family. Developers needs to work at the pairing system...also I saw a class III getting paired up with a class I during a raid.
Mohd Raizal	5	November 7, 2020	Mini game=fishing
EmGuev	5	November 7, 2020	Goods.. now i see the kefir is the dev.. thats why this game is good.. pls add more like grimsoul and lastday.. more events more weapons.. weapon skins, armors, speacialy more familys
Harry Rex	5	November 7, 2020	Awesome survival game,well worth a try
Muhammad Ibrahim Khairull Anuar	5	November 7, 2020	Better version of last day on earth... More fun when playing with friends... Maybe could make a guide for players... Overall let's see how Kefir try to improve this game as I believe you guys care about the community

Peeps	2	November 7, 2020	"I love the game, I love the graphics and everything but theres just one problem about it. Once you joined a family the game won't let you build or collect woods and stones in your homesite. It always says ""you can only collect resourcer in your homesite"" even is I'm at my homesite, and once you left the family, the first home you created will restart and you need to build one again. Can you guys fix it please?"
Syfiq Vic_15	5	November 7, 2020	Kefir you always make best game...tq and goodjob..5 star 🌟
Chris Moses	5	November 7, 2020	"The best ""Non Pay-to-win"" mobile game i've EVER played! There's always something to do!"

Labib Masrafe	4	November 7, 2020	I like this game but when play alone ( not with family) it glitches. And when i play with my family the network is so nice. Why this happens? Plz fix this. So that everyone will play this more

Mark Tenio	4	November 7, 2020	"Should've named this ""Last Grim Soul on Earth"" because this game essentially killed those other two games previously created by the developers. Takes the best of both games and combines em together for a multiplayer experience"
Jaser Monteiro	5	November 7, 2020	Great Game Must download😍😍
Cedie Angelito	5	November 7, 2020	Love the game
Robert Estrada	5	November 7, 2020	I like it

Sreehari Nair	5	November 7, 2020	The bugs have been fixed, kefir! has conquered this genre of gaming.
NMS FOREX	5	November 7, 2020	I put more star this time as you have put a network protocol in the recent update to make it more stable and prevent server disconnect.thank you for your response
Kareem Nafees	5	November 7, 2020	The best game ever!
Charles Lloyd	5	November 7, 2020	Best model game I have ever played..I cant stop playing it
Spartan Of the DaRk	5	November 7, 2020	Great game!
John Wick	4	November 7, 2020	dope game i love most of the features. i love how it lets us change into all three starting jobs to let us use whichever we like. the only problem is that uncraftable items are very rare so it greatly slows down progress of a newcomer. i dont really think its as bad as i am portraying but it took me 3 days to find a single uncraftable item which is kind of a basic item and is used in 1/8 of the recipes. imagine how slow is the growth rate
mandalay ther	5	November 7, 2020	i like this game 🥰🥰🥰
TOM ALEX	3	November 7, 2020	Its a hard game with exclusive multiplayer gameplay than its sister app of same dev ldoe. What makes its grudge is getting a move on.
kael. bz	5	November 7, 2020	Ggwp....
Ilyosbek Shukurullayev	5	November 7, 2020	I like this game
Kizurin SAVIOURS	5	November 7, 2020	I love this spin-off of Last Day on Earth, it is much more fun than LDOE XD, but...well...the problem is the clan limit...why is it only 4 people? Can i ask developer to add something like clan limit is 40 people and add them into 4 by 4 squad? I hope you guys read this, thanks
Somebody Gaming	5	November 7, 2020	Nice game co-op 👏 👌 👍 But I wish There was more dungeons and Armor and Weapons
Chris Corridino	5	November 7, 2020	Yet another great game by Kefir!
Nestil Roy	4	November 7, 2020	The game is very addictive and I suggested my friends to try this game now they are addicted too😂 , but me and my friend feel like there are some issues that needs to be changed like the items are too hard to get and it breaks too quickly and after making the weapons we can't repair things, that make the game a little bit boring, I'm sure almost all players have the same opinion about this, so could you guys fix that for us gamers, besides that overall it's a fantastic game.
Jaime Kalseo	5	November 7, 2020	It was great playing with my friends and reletives!
Lol M	5	November 7, 2020	Idk but I really like this game . This game is not forcing you to buy things you don't need . And umm.. you guys should do something about combat with monsters like when I pass a monster I get damage with no reason . WHYY?????
Dylan Dylan	3	November 7, 2020	It's a good game....but I feel weapons break waaaaaay too quickly...should fix that. Other than that, good game.
Blake drake	5	November 7, 2020	Very good game.more fun with frnds
Mijix	3	November 7, 2020	The game was super nice but i always stuck at loading freeze and when i came back my character was already dead. Fix it please.
sunkara jaswanth	5	November 7, 2020	Nice coop
Eugene Lim	5	November 7, 2020	not bad, not bad
Sangita Patel	5	November 7, 2020	This game is very nice game . I like this game because we can play this game with friends.
Christian Q. Encierto	5	November 7, 2020	Amazing as always with this game i love how you can be with your friend's camp and chat with each other not like your other games, you need to have a certain item to be with your friends but this you and your friends just need to be lvl 5 and invite each other. summary: i love this
Cody Broadway	5	November 7, 2020	Best game ever...but would like to see the repair tables time to be cut in half or more .
TT OzzY	4	November 7, 2020	Everything is just perfect and just awesome, i have played almost all the game similar to this and it's one of the best so far...but it could have been better if tools, weapons and armors durability is a bit stronger and last longer.✌🏻
Ebenami Ez	5	November 7, 2020	Good game
Hamza nc Hamza nc	5	November 7, 2020	Amazing 👌👌
J Jay Jay	5	November 7, 2020	Fun
Lieutenant Taylor	2	November 7, 2020	Overall the game play is good but I've spent over £15 pounds on it and the items you get you dont get too keep. They simply break over time which is really quickly. Would be better if you could fix them after they break. Also if you go into pvp and wear any item you just bought and die you loose everything and the person who killed you keeps your loot as you drop a bag on the floor. Should only drop what you have gathered in your inventory bag. Please change these rules and you get 5 stars
Paul MILLER	1	November 7, 2020	Don't like it , it's already asking to updt. Nfm.
Glen Aramoana	3	November 7, 2020	I've givin' it a 3 star rate! just b'cos of the graphix and b'cos I hav'nt playd it yet! Characters look cool too!
D3ATHROWGAM3R	5	November 7, 2020	It was an honor to play LDOE 2 months after it released and now its an honor to play this game during its alpha build and now im back playing beta and so far ive seen tremendous effort and wish you the best its a balance of f2p and p2w except some things which require alot of grind but i understand kefir needs to make profit so overall Kefir has done a magnificent job caring about the community and their games
giovann dayo	5	November 7, 2020	Its areally goodgame exept its a litle grindy and a some bugs
Yell Win	3	November 7, 2020	Well pretty much p2w btw nonthless no matter how good game feature is... and need protection feature for sudden disconnected players ( i was going into the baldar's cliff my connection lost when i came back im already dead and my dead drop already got looted by other player) . 😇😇 and why the hack just a bag need so high lvl to get? A higher lvl one , while they give rare one for 🤑 in early game.
Omkar Shelar	4	November 7, 2020	Game is really good .... I love RPG games but this game is unique. I really liked it.... But sometimes it suddenly crashes and tools wears to quickly..... Also it will be better if dead respawn in camp area as well.....
DashXZ Tan	4	November 7, 2020	Though its coop but im playing solo. Its playable, free and not overbearing. Though mage and archer have clear advantage over melee at early level during both grind and boss. Progression is seriously slow. Backpack is very limited. 10 slot+5bag early level is very annoying having to run back to cave repeatedly. Quest have good flow. Skill need improvement and unique. TBH dont really standout maybe because im solo. Need some special stuff compare other survival game to hook players
Osaze Aikigbe	5	November 7, 2020	Yep
Breanna Foxy	4	November 7, 2020	Pretty cool
Dermik coastal	5	November 7, 2020	This game improved much from the beta version. The gameplay of frostborn makes it different from other survival game and I'm loving it and fun to play
Homer Simpson	1	November 7, 2020	I see I have been several times robed, but I can't never see anyone in neighborhood !! Simply I don't have items what I work for hardly long time and no chance fight back !! We don't choice participate in PvP but some PvP GHOSTS roobbing us !!! Look to me more like Devs just deleted my items :D No fun at all
name less	4	November 7, 2020	I loved this game this game is best for survival game and it has stunning graphics
Krishna Kolkar	5	November 7, 2020	Average game
Ayan Samadder	5	November 7, 2020	I have played last day survival and the co-op makes the game way better, the community is good and its really fun and the many items and classes are all fun to use.
Who Am i	1	November 7, 2020	It takes a million years to run from PVP. P2W.
Louie Sylvestre Antonio	3	November 7, 2020	Its more better if there's a second chance to change the class
179 Bhoomi Shamvani	1	November 7, 2020	They don't let you revive soon it gives timer by that enemy stole everything I gathered till leval 40 ...and to.pass every level it's too much work I gets very boring and unnecessarily hard after a while
Mahesh kumar	5	November 7, 2020	nice and amazing game have a lot of fun..
black blink • 102 years ago	3	November 7, 2020	Fix weapon durability
Alfie Haimer	5	November 7, 2020	I LOVE IT! Play w ny friends everyday when got the chance. Please make it controller supported devs
predistined sausage	4	November 7, 2020	Noice
Alexander Morgart	4	November 7, 2020	This is probably one of the better adventure rig games I've played. I wish there was more social stuff it seems like most people are on their own. Also the recipes for your work stations don't have much variation some more would be nice.
Samantha Bosley	3	November 7, 2020	its okay but if you buy things prepare not to be able to be refunded. my kid bought stuff and I tried to refund it and was told nothing can be refunded even when I had the items on me still. the coop is ok, finding a decent family that won't rob you is hard. in pve zones people will kite monsters to you to steal your things, be wary!
yechiel arianto	5	November 7, 2020	5 별 ⭐
Bivhab	4	November 7, 2020	Nice but slow
Mohamed Fitri Mohd Daut	5	November 7, 2020	I like the player interaction, very good so far, feels like im not alone

wadza mkwanya	4	November 7, 2020	Very interesting, besides the glitches all is good. I keep warping from one place to another, sometimes I have to restart
Frenz Kenneth Fernandez	4	November 7, 2020	good, awesome, fantastic just what I needed when you guys released your other games, it lacks the multiplayer genre but now it has but it would be great if you put an option to give materials to your friends.
Jiro Rai	5	November 7, 2020	Well it's was very good game
joshua canyeba	5	November 7, 2020	This is what I was waiting for.. me and my friends are enjoying it already.. and it has massive potential.. its very enjoyable

Schalk Engelbrecht	4	November 7, 2020	Pay to progress faster. otherwise play forever to get end game
john michael arcenal	5	November 7, 2020	i enjoyed the challenge of this game
Omar Magdy	5	November 7, 2020	its amazing game in every way just it doesnt have a lot of permenant locations so plz add some permenant lockation and an ability to drop any item to the ground so you teammates could pick it up or any way to share loot rather than putting to boxes overall AMAZING game
Hamza Khan	5	November 7, 2020	That game is good i have alot fun when i play
nastarr.	4	November 7, 2020	Top best games from Kefir!

Jake Lopez	5	November 7, 2020	WC
jackjo joju k	5	November 7, 2020	SOMEONE USING GLITCHES WR CANT TOUCH THEM WHY?
LTLuckGaming l	4	November 7, 2020	1.No energy aquired for traveling nice2.It would be awesome if you could choose a faction like right now we have vikings but maybe in the future we could choose from knights or samurais3.It would be cool if you add like directional melee attacks like how the throwing axe work ,instead of auto lock cuz when i went to a pvp zone,i ambushed a player but he ran straight through drauger and giants and i couldnt hit him and i just died from the giants and clan war would be boring by just autolock pvp
LORD GAMING	3	November 7, 2020	At first it was good but right now game is lacking and now it's not loading check this
Juan Urquizo	1	November 7, 2020	I have a issue after the Update, where a random Draugr spawned in my camp, killed me whilst i was doing crafting, i respawned ,killed the draugr and my items are all gone 4 hours of farming gone without a trace no loot bag, i sent a Report to the agents and have not recieved a response in 5 Hours?! I hope i can get my issues fixed soon. Update: still no reply from agents.. the game is fun, but only 1 server and all these Bugs and Issues, it ruined the game, help agents dont respond, its a mess.
Manuel Santos	4	November 7, 2020	Cool game
A m y r 10	1	November 7, 2020	جوی استیک رو یکم تقویت کنید
Alexander Worley	1	November 7, 2020	You can't opt out or raids which means you lose all the stuff you grind hours for please change :(
Nate Robbins	4	November 7, 2020	Fulfilling and Enjoyable
Sammy Xiong	5	November 7, 2020	I love it but i need to delete me account i made a huge mistake
JherwinPlays	3	November 7, 2020	The game is great, the graphics, the gameplay, everything except for the server though. It keeps on disconnecting even though I have strong internet connection. I tried changing server but same thing still happens. I hope you guys could fix this little problem of mine before it gets big. This'll be a great game soon!
Mahmudul Hasan Maruf	5	November 7, 2020	Excellent Game. Few Developments are needed.
George Ovidiu	5	November 7, 2020	"this game is very awesome i play it on my laptop , because i cant see it on play store on my android phone and it says that my phone is not supported , but i searched ""frostborn apk "" and i installed and it works , not that well but it works . 1gb ram .."
Michael Adegolu	4	November 7, 2020	Good multiplayer games
Muhammad Rasyha	5	November 8, 2020	LOVE IT!!
JEAN SAMUEL Saintvilus	5	November 8, 2020	This here is close to world of warcraft and guild of heroes love that ...my favorite kind of games
Ziad Elsalhy	5	November 8, 2020	I have only one problem when i try to add my friend it say he is in a family already but he is not how can i add my friend ?
No Limits	5	November 8, 2020	It is the best game Kefir released so far, i can see the evolution of Kefir trough playing last day on earth, grim soul, and now this! I love it! Keep it up!
Yakuzaz Boyzs	5	November 8, 2020	The best game....
SARTHAK MOHAPATRA	5	November 8, 2020	Well first things first that game is great. I actually wrote something like this for ldoe when multiplayer was yet to be added but people refused but kefir u have brought that I needed. Graphics like always on the spot yes a little tweak to durability and raiding is needed but that does not require any removing of stars from this game. And I know that u r one of the game creators that actually listen to players and at last I want to say thank you for making my wish true.
Brayden Green	5	November 8, 2020	Nice game overall I would recommend but it does get a little more boring after a while
Jesse Hopper	3	November 8, 2020	The game is decent. The speed of things is slow, and as such makes things like weapons, tools, and armor very valuable, but they also break quickly. The co-op idea is great if you know people that play, or get lucky and find people that play when you do. This game is also fairly pvp based which I don't like. I see the potential of griefing players and just ruining it for people that do not want to pvp. The aggression system sounds like it would help, but I turned that off and was killed.
Progamerssdb Ferreira	5	November 8, 2020	Cooòl af
Evan Septian	1	November 8, 2020	Ujung2nya Gesek kalau mau OP, Rasain aj pas RAID or Ke Map PvP, ketemu yang seimbang mending, ini dihadapin dg player Pay To Win Selevel mah iya tapi item nya Rare semua, dan kalau mati Auto telanjang pas revive, Sia2 aj Grinding berjam2....
ruwan chameera	5	November 8, 2020	this game better than last day on earth because this game co-op . hard to survival. i like that i think we need one marple zone to farm marple . anywhere i rated this game 5 stars.
sheherazade piddock	5	November 8, 2020	The best game I have played
Laylaw Boyd	4	November 8, 2020	Pretty good only problem is farming g is way too hard when mining and items break way too easy
Korean Haizz	1	November 8, 2020	bad
Rocio Salceda	5	November 8, 2020	The quality is great there are zombies and evil alchemists and you can even be one your self you get a choice of being a healer a archer and a warrior they all have their own wepons like the healer has a wand the archer has a bow and the warrior has a sword 10 out of 10 the best game I have ever played enjoy whoever installed this super fun game
Nony Kez_	4	November 8, 2020	It's an amazing game to play with friends .. However, that's the problem .. Why we can't add friends and play together .. Can you make it possible? What's the point got a player id but still can't add friends so please ... Please make it easy to add players!
Harrison Holmes	3	November 8, 2020	Great game just needs a way to get stuff back after death i.e go back and find a bag there with your stuff in. Also you should have a nother set of equipment crafteble from level 2 or 3 maby crude staff, crude sword and shield and crude bow which only do a bit more than fists. If this is done 5 stars all the way. So please take this into account in the next update.
Stefanos Kolovos	5	November 8, 2020	Awesome game! Really fun with friends, progressive and intense, would love tho some customization for the ui, move joystick or the commands. Other than that, awesome!
Fanatic X	4	November 8, 2020	Seems good for now
Anthony Brannon	5	November 8, 2020	For the most part I actually enjoy playing this game cause it's fun and addictive, and there's still a lot more that can be done to the game but devs you guys got five stars from me have a good day!
Delsol Dogg	1	November 8, 2020	Another survival game failure.
phenix plays	1	November 8, 2020	when you die you lose all of your stuff and it is os annnoying!!!
Brandon Price	5	November 8, 2020	I really like the game play. Graphics are great. Just wish the upgraded boots like allow you to move faster but overall a great game.
Mordren Gloom	5	November 8, 2020	Viking rules!!!
We First Gym	5	November 8, 2020	Super
Stephan Koch	5	November 8, 2020	Best game ever
Ultimate Inazuma	5	November 8, 2020	Good
pat a	5	November 8, 2020	Fun like rate of earning no energy mechanics which makes it feel like a real game not money grab.. sped of walking is good. Needs at home resource pool for when u build u don't need to have the items in hand.. but I guess that is for raids.. I am worried I won't be able to progress or enjoy my self if raiding is a must to play...
Budiono Guntoro	4	November 8, 2020	good, for time filled its really good. doing pve and pvp seems fair. the loots though, really suck. well f2p have to suffered i guess
Dream Into Being Homestead	5	November 8, 2020	Pretty fun
Morningstar	5	November 8, 2020	Great game, amazing concept. Few things that can improve it though. Better rewards for a solo player, seeing as it is harder to survive, we lone wolf's should be rewarded for the effort we put in. Also, items break very quickly, not saying the concept of that is bad but maybe higher level gear should break slower so one doesn't have to wait a full 24 hrs just to use our top gear for less than 10 minutes.
xoGOODox	5	November 8, 2020	Addictive AF YOU GOTTA TRY IT MINIMAL LAG BUT LOADS OF FUN AND EXCITING BASES TO BUILD WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU CAN RAID OTHER PLAYERS FOR LOOT AS WELL AS PVP BATTLES WITH EACHOTHER. ALLIANCES AND EVERYTHING LOOK ME UP IN NORTH AMERICAN REGION/ LukeSkyWalker is my family name!!! Come join me and lets rule together!!
Karl Espinoza	4	November 8, 2020	Started playing at at last so far so good, crashed later in the day but at least I got out of the starting zone. So I'll come back later. To give it another go.
Shania Cadman	1	November 8, 2020	I'm done playing your guys's game I had so much stuff in my inventory and then I accepted and joined a clan and the guy took me for everything he starts with a letter a and he's about level 99 until I get all my stuff back your guys's game is awful there's too many hackers I'm getting my stuff raided where they just steal everything you can't enter a zone without a hacker killing you I'm not playing the game until I get all my or wood Stone everything back to be honest now your game gets a zero
Jeremy Squiers	1	November 8, 2020	Great idea of a diablo-esque type of game but the app is constantly restarting and lagging
bajrang mohite	5	November 8, 2020	One of the best survival game
GX GAMER	4	November 8, 2020	NICE GAME BUT YOU CHOULD ADD NEW STYLE OF GUNS AFTER THAT ITS GOOD GAME
Bahamut Storm	5	November 8, 2020	11/10 would DEFINITELY recommend!!
Ganesh Javalekar	4	November 8, 2020	Please improve speed of servival if speed was fast our gameplay was doing fast.
CHRIS Alvarez	5	November 8, 2020	God as hell
Alexander Parra	5	November 8, 2020	Hasta ahora va muy bien, le estare informando que tal.
James Phillips	5	November 8, 2020	Been playing this game for about 2 weeks and loving every minute
Jair Hernandez	5	November 8, 2020	Graphics are gorgeous. Enjoying the max graphics of this game. Norse mythology and spell casting. It's free on top of that and there's multilayer!!!
Destany Bennett	1	November 8, 2020	Very bad game i cant install
ali piri	5	November 8, 2020	😍😍😍👌👌👌👌👌👌👌❤
Casey Gobel	5	November 8, 2020	I really am enjoying this game, I'm interested to see what will be added in future updates.
Jack Church	5	November 8, 2020	Lots of fun especially with friends
Vlatko Angelov	5	November 8, 2020	Cool
OfficialSabbath Moke	5	November 8, 2020	Wicked game if give it 10 stars if it had that option
Darion Ehret	5	November 8, 2020	Good game. A few bugs, and I which stuff had a description so you knew what it was. Anyways really good game.
Zanda 5	1	November 8, 2020	this game ask me to change the server for 2nd time
Matt Banks	5	November 8, 2020	Love the game idea
Alex Jr. Rosadiño C.	5	November 8, 2020	Thank you for quick response 😍
joni jonas	5	November 8, 2020	Started today I enjoy I am not person that's easy like some games this one Worth tray only problem is hard too find friend or family I hope the develop make something in this direction.
M. Nagy	5	November 8, 2020	I like this game very much the only issue for free players is getting silver coins i wish for more ways to get those coins..but overall this is the greatest multiplayer survival game ever played... great job guys.
Christian Black	4	November 8, 2020	Was gonna leave a five but, there is always room for improvement. Thought I might have been fated to be a farmer when I first started playing but, things moving along nicely. The only thing is, all those weapons we cant use in the beginning? I wish there were explanation about what IS required to use them, otherwise its great.
Danielle Garnett	3	November 8, 2020	The games good but after you die it's hard recrafting tools. I really hate that I lose all my things, that's really fustating. I don't like pvp cause I loose all my things
Keitaa Gremory	4	November 8, 2020	I wasted my wood trying to build more of my hut in the tutorial and I can't place any wood in the cart to further the quest. I'm effectively stuck without any way to do anything. Please help! I would love to be able to actually try the game...
Frank Brown	5	November 8, 2020	Ok this game is s BLAST and a great time sink. The best advice i can give to new players is USE THE SNEAK BUTTON, youll do x2 surprise damage! And DONT GET BENT OUT OF SHAPE IF YOU DIE AND LOSE YOUR LOOT!! The game is designed AROUND being able to simply acquire more ....and get RIGHT BACK at pvp or pvm. Ive foolishly lost a full hero of epics, and had another whole set later that day. And wasnt even near max level. Just make sure u make a few of each spear, hatchet, and pickaxe and stash them.
Melissa Manery	1	November 8, 2020	I'm still stuck at level 99
Robert Monaghan	4	November 8, 2020	I would enjoy the game better if the server wasn't so busy I can not log in
RiOtX	5	November 8, 2020	Awsome game very good handling I like the plot of the game but I have a problem the damage from lower level enemy's are alot I don't know if other people have this problem but this game is amazing!
Kenneth Ansus	2	November 8, 2020	I can't play the game. I have played it once but when i tried to log out and open it again i can't play the game i would like to give it 5 stars if you fix the game please i really like the game after my first try playing it so i hope you would fix it
Marshall Carr	5	November 8, 2020	Awesome
Daz Hauer	5	November 8, 2020	I love this game im pretty sure its now my favourite games you made compare to grim souls or ldoe the 3 things that made me so happy was the first thing is that a berry in your second slot actually fills up when you pick berry up on ldoe you just have to open inv then do it manally then another one is that the game ACTUALLY uses the lowest durablity tools then highest ones and the main is that as far as i can tell there is no energy usage im an old ldoe fan as you can tell 😅anyway great game
The professional Cat	5	November 8, 2020	Absolutely love this game!
SING KONG	5	November 8, 2020	SEMPUURNAAAAAA
spencer grover	5	November 8, 2020	Cool game after playing the game it becomes easyer to play
Doug Stover	4	November 8, 2020	It's a wonderful game....I can't afford pay to play
RedCloud YesIndeed	3	November 8, 2020	"Has potential, but I really dislike short the duration of special events can be. Lost a lot of good gear because of that, uninstalled. Edit: honestly, the only thing I would change, is some balancing issues, like, this was the First ""boss"" i encountered, and I probably could have muscled through, If there was more time. So I guess, either better balancing with event stuff, for new characters, Or, more time on events?"
Wesley Kilmer	5	November 8, 2020	I love it great mobile game way better then the other games like it
Joseph Savona	2	November 8, 2020	I want to like it but the PVP is over whelming... I can take the risk of getting destroyed when I'm out gathering risk you take .. But to be invaded every 2 days in pvp raids to loose everything I can't hide... No way not doing this
Kain Pendragon	2	November 8, 2020	"As of nov. 7 of 2020 the game is so thick of pvp that there is no use doing the stroy line some mod are OP but there slow so you an avoid the one hit kill. But if you play story line dont it this game is a shity way of saying a cheep knock off of ""C.S. go"" well as of this date."
Shawn M. Wilson	1	November 8, 2020	Frustrated 😞 This game can't be played without a wifi connection. It should be playable using mobile data like Last Day on Earth, Grim Souls, and Jurassic Survival. Not playing until they fix this issue, because I am sick and tired of losing connection just walking from one chest to another in my base and when out collecting resources, which causes me to get killed and start over 😡😡😡 I am also tired of the person responding for Kefir on here. They don't realize that devs don't listen!🤨🤨🤨
Chad Gray	5	November 8, 2020	Pretty decent game.
Yan Mayatski	5	November 8, 2020	"All those games use the same layout, but this game went the extra mile and added very nice features as well as removed some of the enough ""money making"" things like energy to travel. Seems like you do not need to pay for it to be fun, haven't played enough so will update in the future."
Dee Owens	5	November 8, 2020	It looks really good and I hope there is chat tho
Patricia Lopez	1	November 8, 2020	Need work
Michael Fitz	4	November 8, 2020	Very enjoyable..i really dont care for survival games but this one caught my attention and o already been playing 6 hourd and its is my first time downloading it.
James Alchin	5	November 8, 2020	Loving being able to play without pay lol
Kevin Langman	1	November 8, 2020	Game wouldn't load on mobile data even though it's very stable with a consistent 58mbps. Would like to give it a 5 start but only being able to play on wifi kinda ruined that... unfortunate.
Kaspy J	5	November 8, 2020	Good so far
Robert Stritzinger	5	November 8, 2020	Good fun game
Shana B	3	November 8, 2020	If there was a way to avoid pvp in ALL areas and have better weapons and better durability of everything for those of us who are truly playing the game as a f2p player, I would gladly give 5 stars. Until then, 3 stars it is.
Kyle Friend	1	November 8, 2020	Can't connect to any server
Aelyn Magtibay	5	November 8, 2020	i like this game, the more time i spend the more my character becomes stronger. its hard to beat the monster in the dungeon so i need more weapons and more armors but i dont have money to buy the strong one, thats why i need more time to find rare items and be patient. in the end im happy to play this game. 😇
Rahul dragneel	5	November 8, 2020	good game but server problems cuz its in early stage
Sione Paueli	5	November 8, 2020	Good games I ever play, I enjoy it, hope you updates for a new one someday iiooopppp
Justin Walker	5	November 8, 2020	Hands down an amazing game, progress can be rough but with your team... Easily achieved
Shylo Shylo	4	November 8, 2020	For a game that's in beta is surprisingly good. Certain things can be completely removed from the game such as hunger and thirst as I always end up drinking and eating to gain health instead but other than that this game is perfect
TheWickedJester	1	November 8, 2020	Tried to do a raid today, as soon as it found me a match it booted me from the server and I haven't been able to get on since....looks like I'll be deleting this
Deejay GAMER	5	November 8, 2020	This game is freaking amazing it is so awesome but there are some g litches but still amazing🥰
Paul Addington	5	November 8, 2020	Really fun
Nica Garvida	3	November 8, 2020	I mean it's good. it's just that. I don't like to keep looking a recipes... I mean if you can put a checklist for what ever we are combining better
Varinder Dhillon	1	November 8, 2020	Very bad game . All of my teammates took all of my stuff and kicked me out of there family. And i quite the game. My family members were so bad. And this game allowed them to pick all of my stuff. There should be a restriction that u can't take all of stuff from others. I feel scammed now.
jett makilan	5	November 8, 2020	Goodgame, it has a potential.. can't wait for it to be updated. Plss add more weapons and tools
jovani	1	November 8, 2020	I guess this game was made strictly for Caucasian players. Not a single option to make your avatar black or dark brown. Hard pass for me.
AnTDraGoN	3	November 8, 2020	Not bad game
TheBlitzBear G	5	November 8, 2020	Really enjoying the game, love the co op aspect of it and being able to see your team build their base while you build yours,sometimes keep disconnecting and losing everything but small price to pay for the good feeling it brings.
Aung Thu Rein	5	November 8, 2020	Myanmar players come to me. China server. Name- ReinKoMin
Raees Mohammed	3	November 8, 2020	Game is fun and would highly recommend. why it loses stars is because purchasing anything in this game with real money makes 0 sense. You pay X amount of money for your really cool gear then you die, someone else can pick it up and now they have your gear. you paid $5 for someone else to have your gear. If you don't die? Someone can raid your base and steal it! Plzmake a chest that you only put premium items in protected from raider. Also repair station takes too long to repair after I paid $5.
Michael Amparo	5	November 8, 2020	This game is awesome. Hoping for further updates.
renton Odko	4	November 8, 2020	Vgh
sek sovandara	5	November 8, 2020	Nice n addict.
Tyler Wang	5	November 8, 2020	Incredible game with awesome contents and very attractive interactive systems. The only bad part is experiencing lags somewhere and there but overall what a awesome game!
Danish Aufa Muhammad Nazri	5	November 8, 2020	Addictive,improved resources management skill,improved strategy organization skill,improved our instict about the surroundings,fun events,competitive simple events for a new game.I hope you can improve/add more the event,add more vehicle,weapons,armor,camp defences and facilities and also improve the map content or expand it for better experience for players.I hope this game goes popular same like the Last Day on Earth game.And last thing!...plis dont make this game into(Pay to Win)we preder F2P
Game Nation	5	November 8, 2020	Lots to do. Very fun and addicting. Only thing would be durations on weapons and armor to be longer.
EdAnt Hue	5	November 8, 2020	Yourll die by everything i love it The game will kill you Monsters will kill you People will kill you Not knowing what to do in the beginning will kill you Itz very much like rust and for being a mobilr game i love it
James Belcher	1	November 8, 2020	Very good game besides the durability equiment even purple all last the same as normal ones and you need to stop the damge on all items u have on you even in the bag when u go down or die everthing u have takes damge even if not equpied dam scam
Neil Cuenca	5	November 8, 2020	Nice
Juice_wrld_999 999	1	November 8, 2020	Thay stole a hole other games concept but it was zombies even the grafex I haven't played it but it sounds the same
men cili	1	November 8, 2020	lag
akhil sachu	5	November 8, 2020	I love the my brother addicted little bit he loves the nice game and 'WOW'
Gabriel Goardy	4	November 8, 2020	i wish last day on eartg have the co-op feature too... i prefer the zombie survival theme rather than medieval but still this game is quite fun
manuel laserna	5	November 8, 2020	Nice game and somewhat challenging on finding igems but not to difficult yet time consuming though but all in all greag game
Overwharf	1	November 8, 2020	Boring slog, dont belive the lies wait times are pervasive.
mrbonnie20	5	November 8, 2020	Frostborn is dope, at first glance I thought it was going to be like last day on earth with the same mechanics and everything but nope the game showed good gameplay that's worth anyone's time that would absolutely love to play a certain fighting class like mages, Sharpshooters or Warrior class and the outcome is that you don't need energy which makes people hooked on to a game where you can play for a long time and not have to use energy like in last day on earth, The game is Good.
Sainttino Wilson	5	November 8, 2020	This is one amazing game and love the fact that you can join your friends and family into battle. Only sad thing is that when u die you lose it all lol but its alright.
GillaPlayer YT	5	November 8, 2020	This game is growing fast due to the developers listening I enjoyed last day on earth but the energy bar hurts the games reputation, frostborn is different which makes players willing to play survival games interested in it, the Graphics and gameplay are extremely beautiful and enjoy the game a lot.
Arupo Engti	1	November 8, 2020	This is best survival game ever
bilal mirza	4	November 8, 2020	Good game and the developers are working to make it even better I have on request to the developers to make an option of having a name on the chest because without it it's hard to find the objects when there are too many chests in your home plz make this option to make easier to play
Wind Weaver	3	November 8, 2020	Great game but pls fix a problem with wifi and mobile networks you can't load the game while on wifi but when your on mobile network it works. I can't play the game because of it
ZombiKillingSexAddict NpC	4	November 8, 2020	Loving the game Only thing I have a few concerns is Loot: Maple tree:Make it were theirs more then 1maple tree or atleast site you can go to in early game Loot Timer: With the 1st one being an issue of someone already making it to the site have an option were we can reset/refresh loot maybe? Resin/oil/chain/glue: why cant we craft them in any benches or have an option too do so Repair bench: (if you bought one) Depending on damage it should vary from time to repair instead of always 24hours
Michael Burgess	2	November 8, 2020	Not interested in forced PvP.
Mohd. Faizan Rizvi	4	November 8, 2020	Awesome game. Totally enjoying it. There are some minor things that can be made even better but this is good enough for me 😊
Jonathan Hardin	5	November 8, 2020	The game is fun and challenging
wubbalubba dubbdubbb	3	November 8, 2020	Cool game but after update it a little bit lag🤔
Sebastian Mullis	3	November 8, 2020	I think it has potential to be a 5 star game. I really enjoy building and gathering. The classes were an awesome addition to this style of game as well. Have to give it three stars though due to the server in North America being so high I can only access it at night usually. Once again, great game with great potential, if you can log in.
PoundOfPotatoes	5	November 8, 2020	You guys fixed the chat thank you! 5* game for sure good job!
Acaian AWG DAMIT	5	November 9, 2020	Good graphic n gameplay...i like the multiplayer thing...you can co-op with other to conquer dungeon...ha3
devil gamer	5	November 9, 2020	Good
Allen Wireman	5	November 9, 2020	Great game!
Mike Chesney	5	November 9, 2020	I've played ALOT of last days on earth and this game is a 10x better version the co-op is on point!
Stewart Stephenson	1	November 9, 2020	Complete Garbage, was on the game 30 minutes and got raided by 4 people and couldn't do anything to stop them and they took everything I had worked to get. Development team you are nothing but money grabbing scumbags. In response to your reply, how do you expect one starting person to have any chance against 4 people? There should be a restriction of people allowed to raid 1v1 or a buff for people at there own base??
Liridon Alji	5	November 9, 2020	Have been waiting for something like this really long , and definitely this game take the crown. Good job to the dev team, only thing i would say is to make more locations with no pvp. 🙋‍♂️
Drake Hayes	5	November 9, 2020	Best game I've ever played, also how can I reset my data for my account on here so I can restart again.
John Mortenson	5	November 9, 2020	Very fun. Cool co op. Features
Sam Wu	5	November 9, 2020	Its keep saying you have lost connection and need to restart the game after the update? Is it a maintenance or what?
Shane Elliott	5	November 9, 2020	Good hat looking all my good stuff that buy with $$$ .
Kelly Ruiz Calimpusan	5	November 9, 2020	Its so cooooooooollllll
Peter Garrity	4	November 9, 2020	Its a great game love everything about it its been done right and has the right amout of difficulty
Canasion	5	November 9, 2020	Dradf
Madeliene Gracia	1	November 9, 2020	Lag so much so uninstall it. If you already fix the connection. Let me know. I will try it again. Maybe gave you better star
Droyer	1	November 9, 2020	I know you guys don't care but this is the 2nd time it happens. There is a problem in the game where if I die in my camp of hunger I lose everything. I was afk for a few minutes while I was eating and I died and lost my purple bag with all the resources I had from gathering in green wood zone. Before this I lost a whole set of instigator plus a wrath staff and I wrote tou guys about it but no reply at all. Well...
animesh yadav	1	November 9, 2020	Another pay 2 win by kefir after grim soul. Game becomes very hard and boring if you are alone. Once you find a family and if you find out that players of family are inactive you have to wait again for 24 hours to join or create new one. Secondly, for constructing nails you need workbench and for workbench you need copper and for copper you need strong pickaxe and for that you again need nails. Common items to make decent equipments are also rare. That's ridiculously boring.
Owadokun Moses	2	November 9, 2020	I play on 4g network.. for a kefir game, this one sucks my bandwidth fast.. this and weapon breakage is my deal breaker.. improve
Zaid Mazin	5	November 9, 2020	This game awesome thx kefir
Zech Cross	5	November 9, 2020	Despite the neck choking in game purchase, the game really is nice. I suggest this features years ago. Only now kefir made it. Thanks for making this beautiful durango subtitute. I hope there will be more coop quest & less pvp, no raid. Raid seriously spoils people mood & hard work. Because other games does it, it doesn't mean you have to make the feature as well.
jhomyr abrenica	3	November 9, 2020	I only give this game a 3 star because theres a room for improvement but this is a good game for those who love building and survival games
Arthur De Leniq	1	November 9, 2020	I accidentaly deleted my old review , basicly you can only plas a a phisical class , healer and magic classes are ONLY TO DUNGEON AND RAIDS becuse the staff is too fragile to use reliabily and WAY TOO EXPENSIVE TO MAKE ALL THE TIME , tbe game after lvl 50 becomes repetitive and boring
Ron Sam	4	November 9, 2020	I love this game but the thing is u can play with only three of ur friends, I wish the count was more.
soul harvester	4	November 9, 2020	I like the game but I'm already seeing a few problems. One main problem that's giving me great anoyence is that it take 1 hour and 20 minutes to craft 20 planks that's way to long because it takes 20 planks to upgrade one flipping wall so just to upgrade most of my base just to get passed the first walls I gotta practically take the entire day to wait for the planks to do it from just two woodworking tables. Can yhall make an official firstborn discord server please it whould be very useful :)
Jason Baker	5	November 9, 2020	Im really liking this game so far
Demon K40	5	November 9, 2020	Just waste your money because its worth it. Okay the real reason i say this is because the more money we use the more updates they can make to make the game even better. They should have a regen armor which only work with any type of healing spell equipped, or when you eat food you heal and then regen for double the amount you healed for.(ex: you heal for 10 and plus 10 for regen. The armor only activate with healing spells equipped, but it just doubles heals and makes the cooldown faster)
Naruto Uzumaki	5	November 9, 2020	Perfect
Demetric Henry	3	November 9, 2020	It is a combination game of build/survive with regard elements. The build/survive is a copy/paste of an old zombie survival game i played long ago.
Joel Garbo Maravillas	5	November 9, 2020	great
Cindy Clingan	3	November 9, 2020	Has really bad connection problems. I'm on great fast wifi and ever 3 minutes it says lost servers when I'm still connected and working.. please please fix this issue I really love this game over then that.
Tinovo	5	November 9, 2020	awesome experience, a really grindy game but if you like that its awesome
Joe B	5	November 9, 2020	No longer crashing great ge thanks
mariano rotonda	5	November 9, 2020	Love the game I think it has all the elements Ldoe might be missing or that I was looking for in a game, love that it doesn't have energy that drains when travelling, tons of rss needed to upgrade so it still makes you grind so you won't get bored with the game
Michael Lalonde	5	November 9, 2020	Excellent game
Dominic Andino	5	November 9, 2020	Hard AF! But fun none the less. Watch a few YouTube videos to get the basics on base building as you can get raided and your stuff taken.
愛染 Aizen	3	November 9, 2020	Kinda Bad but not that Bad, since stamina is not needed to go to different Areas in the game, but i hope you lessen the difficulty for each Areas its too hard when item durability is easily depleted, and allowing the possibility of changing class is kinda BAD should stick to single class and single class advancement not allowing class jumping from one to another😑
Jason Brown	1	November 9, 2020	Prepare to spend hours upon hours collecting stuff all for a squad of pay to win players to come kill you and raid your base of everything you own because they bought better weapons,armour and bombs to raid your base. Don't waste your time.
J. Jones	1	November 9, 2020	Bad update! this update is causing me more problems than before. I've died 3 times in an hour after I lost contact with the server
angel martinez	1	November 9, 2020	I have been waiting for this game for a long time now but I can't get passed the loading screen it keeps telling me I have a connection issue with the server
Kaitlin Secord	1	November 9, 2020	FIX THE GLITCHING. Sick of dying because the game freezes as you get mobbed by everything around you.
TheChronichabitz	5	November 9, 2020	Best version of this gameplay by far. Worth a download.
Earegood	5	November 9, 2020	This game is great and it has a great co'op plus its free
tim vesper	1	November 9, 2020	Terrible! You face too many powerful enemies in the lowest, green areas! Ridiculous! Awful! Not going to try game again, thank goodness it was free!
jt austin	1	November 9, 2020	Unable to connect to server
Drubanian	5	November 9, 2020	This game is a whole ton of fun. It was first hard to understand the concept and how it works but once you play for a bit you will understand. Great job devs!
zephule stargazer	1	November 9, 2020	Get ready for whales to come and attack you when the 3 days of protection is over. Seemed fun at first but then I discovered that others could come and take your resources.
John Mike	5	November 9, 2020	So far Its not difficult like last day on earth, where you die you never see your items again and the only thing i hate is that in green zones you have to compete with other player with collecting resources.
Morrison Coal	5	November 9, 2020	Well as for kefir always five star but hope this new game is great like grimsoul and last days on earth
Luke Steele	2	November 9, 2020	Just the same common game style. Seen lots of games like this. But big issue on this is PvP. Just and endless grind for resources (unless you pay to win) Note for devs: Aggressor mode needs to be fixed; when i have aggressor mode off, you cant attack players even if they are attacking you.I love games with strict pvp competition in games but is extremely unfair for players to have to wait 10 seconds for aggressor mode to turn on when another player is literally attacking you.
Graeme Oxley	1	November 9, 2020	Typical whale bait. Developer sells endgame gear loot boxes, gives endgame gear to low level players with premium status, and gear repairs are monetized. If you enjoy being food for whale players, then you'll love it.
Brandon Savoie	1	November 9, 2020	Just downloaded and just started playing pretty bad server or server maitiance keeps disconnecting every 3 to 4 minutes and severe lag had no issue with other games just this 1 please fix connection issues or server issues didnt even have a chance to build yet would have loved to get a feel for the game but cant play till its fixed. P.S. please add a repair system for equipmemt such as weapons and gear to repair it it should cost less than what it costs to build initially and be based on usage.
green 617doge	1	November 9, 2020	Sucks
Bessie Aranzanso	5	November 9, 2020	Real free to play with good gameplay mechanics. One of the best multiplayer rpg. Cheers for not implementing the energy to travel. Great work.
Pop Sandor	5	November 9, 2020	Amazing!
Mr Crewmate	1	November 9, 2020	Coz too long to download
Nik Berthelette	5	November 9, 2020	Finally! An adventure RPG that has a perfect mix of free and pay content. Pve and pvp and spread out enough that it's not daunting, no travel costs (play all day). I got to lvl 25 in 2 days without spending any real money. Definitely worth a play
BeBe Wolf	5	November 9, 2020	This game is sorta addicting.
Minh Lê	1	November 9, 2020	The game is insanely laggy some times and it might cost you a lot. I died and lost everything to a lag so I uninstalled the game.
rezz z	5	November 9, 2020	It good
jeff hubley	1	November 9, 2020	Full of cheaters and bugs...couldnt exit area..killed too many times...game is in no way free friendly..very heavy pay to win
mark cabigao	5	November 9, 2020	i love this game
William Snavely	4	November 9, 2020	EDITED: Thank you developer. Since the last update it seems like connection issues have been a bit better. 😀 This is a very fun survival game otherwise.
Allan Gador	5	November 9, 2020	Good game
MAYLAN DIAMANTE	3	November 9, 2020	Great game so far...but there is a problem in server,it always crushing my game and its hard to connect..always coonecting to server..hope you fix this problem..
Jerry Dupeire	5	November 9, 2020	How do you get unstuck went to vault and glitch happened now I'm in black and it won't let me leave
Neo160	5	November 9, 2020	The BEST in the genre Theres NO ENERGY BAR. NO FUEL. Just travel and play as much as you want! Theres pvp and non pvp zones. The coop system is INCREDIBLE.
Philip Kilworth	5	November 9, 2020	Great combination of farming type and RPG games. One word? Awesome
Joe Price	5	November 9, 2020	Just a great game
PHROG森	5	November 9, 2020	Siuk
CREEPER AWW	5	November 9, 2020	This game is amazing its a mix of Last day on earth with grim soul survival but multiplayer but iam having a issue which is the server iam in main asia and its sometime very laggy even if i have a good internet but when at night its not lag so much
manuel cabrera	3	November 9, 2020	Server Keeps rebooting everyday can be frustrating
All games tamil	2	November 9, 2020	Super game
GK JAGANMITHRA	5	November 9, 2020	More op
James Ranson	5	November 9, 2020	I'm having a great time
Abbil Lantang	5	November 9, 2020	Great survival game
Senki	1	November 9, 2020	Just as everyone has been saying, it's pretty darn irritating when you die, I died twice cuz the game started teleporting me to random areas of the map and started glitching like crazy, im done with this game, best o luck
Bro Jama	1	November 9, 2020	Take out raids and it may be a good ish game
Vihanga Lakruwan	1	November 9, 2020	How to play fast steps.....? Its complicated.... no gaid.... damm it... 💩
Strawberry Milk	3	November 9, 2020	Decent game but progress is slow. Things break easily and the stack of each item was only 20 which is fairly low if you want to grind.
Nhadz Lu	5	November 9, 2020	Fun to play. Very immersive gameplay.good job devs!
boweeili	5	November 9, 2020	👌
gusti pamungkas	1	November 9, 2020	The game is frustating to play solo, the button is too small and tight i often to misclick button, weapon break too easily, and it's quite hard to even make one. I usually can have fun with grinding game, but there's no fun in grinding in this game. And drop system when you die, you lost everything. Bruh if you brought many good spare equipment and you happen to die, you f***** up lost all of those thing. Should've drop only item you've gathered on the island. I REGRET GIVING THIS GAME A CHANCE.
Ross Grant	5	November 9, 2020	I like
Slayer 4TK	3	November 9, 2020	Shhhhhh.....dont bother me im in game, cya there Edit:pay to win early game,had to be said.5 star to 3 star.
Rama Illiniputra	4	November 9, 2020	Finally ! Another great survival game, pretty solid game, although need some polishing 'cause some glitch and bugs. Another thing that would improve the game is the ability to self heal when at camp (just like Last Day of Survival) so i dont have to spend a lot of my resources just to heal after a resource run. Overall, it will be perfect once the game completly finished.
Mr Together	4	November 9, 2020	It's a great game. Needs some improvements of course but of course it's an early access. But it's great. I recommend it to anyone who likes survival games.
Arvin Caña	1	November 9, 2020	Game concept is good.it would been a 5 star if you can fix the sliding glitch..i drop all my very rare item because of that..i cant do anything..cant fight back because of that it just thrown me everywhere..that is unacceptable..
Jim Ramos	2	November 9, 2020	It's a fun game specially with friends but damn is the server slow, it lags often and it's not cause of my internet. There's also this one time that I died then when I try to get back my stuff the server is full and I cant even play the game? What luck huh? It's annoying, really annoying. I hope you fix this, I'm slowly regretting spending my time in this game.
Bobodi Bobogjie	1	November 9, 2020	Dont spend money of this game.
noobish shant	5	November 9, 2020	Cool
Zack Ahmad	5	November 9, 2020	Finally survival i could play with friends. This is great. I just hoped it could support controller thou. I enjoyed the game. Keep up the good work
Pouria Mouezzy	2	November 9, 2020	The game stucks on the first loading and just watching photos Why?
Thangdaikub94 Anhemminh94	1	November 9, 2020	Vừa tải về vào game cái lại bắt update luôn. Khó hiểu vc
Dayasagar Pradhan	5	November 9, 2020	I am old player of frostborn I have nothing give me some wepon Please Please Please
Conan Edugawa	4	November 9, 2020	So far so good, just the server issue where you get lag sometimes.
Alek	5	November 9, 2020	🤙
Lanz Andrei Tingson	2	November 9, 2020	Errmmm i keep getting stuck at the loading screen, its saying initializing but its not proceeding in the game
Tim Reedy	1	November 9, 2020	You will die and lose everything, repeatedly. every other player you encounter will gather any mob they could find and run then into you, killing you immediately. Then proceed to take all your valuables before you get the chance to go back. Not a game to waste your time with, honestly.
BROZE YT	5	November 9, 2020	I love this game but please fix the server ping of the main asia but i love this thank u

James Journigan	5	November 9, 2020	Best survival game out there
ijogo oitjhtoij	1	November 9, 2020	----- Grind fest ----- Pay to win ----- Cancer PVP ----- Don't bother ----- As a free player you are a sitting duck for paying players to hunt. Cancer PVP everywhere apart from 2 starter maps.High level players left to freely kill low lever newbs. Even on the non PVP maps, high level players constantly attract monsters to you and kill you, so they collect all your items. Very bad gaming experience. There is no coop whatsoever. Lots of bugs, bad controls. Do not bother.
JINI GAMES	5	November 9, 2020	Now this is called co:op game I'm loving this game so far and this game is what I'm hoping to get in last day on earth but I don't think that game is ever going to get true multiplayer.
Dinesh Rizal	1	November 9, 2020	I always get match with two.players even if i m.solo
Jeff Atkinson	1	November 9, 2020	Could not start game
Gerónimo Gelves	4	November 9, 2020	I love this game!! It's just amazing. It looks like one of s list of games like this but it's amazing the fact that it's online and you can choose if you want to be a warrior, a curator, am archer, etc. The only problem I've seen its the connection issues, it happens often and it's tiring... But the game is the best!
Rahmat Tria Sandi	5	November 9, 2020	Great game !!! I like it
Time and Illusion	1	November 9, 2020	Wont load tells me to choose a server and I do and it doesn't work. Uninstalled and tried again and tried different servers not so high and still wont load. Dissapointed.
No ob	5	November 9, 2020	Worth it, no energy bars just grind as much as you want.
catalin buse	5	November 9, 2020	good now just make it better and better
Des TCY	4	November 9, 2020	You need to improve the information of item,and make more place to play ...i like to play this game and i just download yesterday and today i am 26 level....and make a guild ..family can only 4person play..but i have lot of friends..we cant play together..
IMMORTAL GAMING	5	November 9, 2020	BEST GAME I PLAY ON MY EVER LIFE
WolfByte Blair	3	November 10, 2020	its a great game but i cant enjoy it because of the sliding and lag. I have great wifi but it needs some kind of debug for that before i can continue to play this
Wizard Master	3	November 10, 2020	It's one of the great game but l deleted yesterday because of ride it's wrong thing you must ride to protect your base it's destroy the game l hope your company fix that and change         a ride like last day on earth in this game if you ride then you should worry about your base .. it's better I hope read that and listen our suggestions
Bagus Mahendra	5	November 10, 2020	Overall awesome! knowing that I dont have to wait hours and hours for the energy to filled to go anywhere on the map. I looking further how the gameplay can go and also other features. If its still free roam for long time, i'm ready to throw big bucks into this.
Abhilash S	5	November 10, 2020	Nice and addictive game well done developers😊
sajidur rahman Bhuiyan	1	November 10, 2020	too much pvp make me want to quit. Why do you put pvp on important location like near maple tree when it is hard to make heavy axe? Games shouldn’t be this frustrating.
Kamuela Kailua	1	November 10, 2020	Beginners have no chance to grow unless you spend cash. I am lvl 18 (played 1 week) lost resources by Raiders. 2 days prior got kicked off server. This is like their other game. Beginners are used as farms for higher raiders. Don't bother. In reponse. The pvp Raiders attacked my base and removed my resources. So unless I pay cash I will be farmed while trying to upgrade my base. Not spending cash to be farmed for resources.
Steven West	1	November 10, 2020	Can't connect to any server. Want to check out game, but won't connect. I'm playing on the moto stylus
Zaffan Azfar	5	November 10, 2020	Padu mat
Ian Quirao	5	November 10, 2020	I cant move the floor and walls the game js reeboting we cant play the tools and equipment break faster
Konchen Carrasco	5	November 10, 2020	It a magical experience boom🎉
Matthew Wells	5	November 10, 2020	Awesome game
nameFirst nameLast	1	November 10, 2020	Dumbass devs made it so base pvp raids occur at random time and only for 20 min so if you miss the time frame everything is lost
Joshua Cleghorn	3	November 10, 2020	Very good game however the raid matching could use a little work In game trading and communication is good Overall not a bad game would recommend to friends
Ryan Jay	2	November 10, 2020	it's good but I lose my tier 3 items with a enemy who I made peace with so I deleted it
Gamernerd 64	4	November 10, 2020	I'll give it a 4 star review becouse of the durability on equipment is just terrible. It's a great game it's just that the durability is just bad so your constantly wasting resources when I need it to progress farther in the game so pls fix this
ABDO BASHIR	2	November 10, 2020	The game is good . But after 2 days playing this game the game stop reload in 100% i wait for hour to open but no result i dont know what is the reason of the problem Oh and im sorry if my english isnot alright
Nason Dalack	1	November 10, 2020	Bad. Unless you have real good Wifi you cannot play this game.
Alex Emil	3	November 10, 2020	Probably 1 of the best games out there but sadlye there still bugs like i just lost my house i joined a familie and my homeland had just trees when i tried to harvest them it appears like i cant because its not my site. Please fix this ive been trying to play for days but unforntunaly i cant withouth a house hope you fix it
Jay Ortiz	5	November 10, 2020	I love this game so much because of the grind to upgrade the district and to make stuff and the raids and that it is multiplayer.
DORAEMON	5	November 10, 2020	Good game but controls are not comfortable
Lwallis101	1	November 10, 2020	God, all i was doong was travaling and then i get instakilled for no reason. I was stuck in a loop for 10 mins. I dont recommend this unless you want to glide on the floor as enemies kill you and you do no damage
Shan Chipo	2	November 10, 2020	Imagine an hermit locking at u like an aa batterie then dying cause the stun followed u fifty miles away I hope u add an dodge button otherwise this games is a farmville not an survival game
oliver santiago	5	November 10, 2020	Fun
Deon Gordon	5	November 10, 2020	This game is absolutely fantastic. Now they do need to work on targeting because healing family members is unnecessarily difficult. Even with that though this is the best mobile game I've ever played. They also need a better tutorial. Specifically explaining hud icons.
Alex As	3	November 10, 2020	I would give more stars, but I have a problem with item durability, what's the point in looking for components for 20 minutes if the item is gonna get destroyed in 3 minutes, maybe 2.
Piko	5	November 10, 2020	العبة جامدة بس مش عارف هى اشتغلت يومين وبعدين مش راديه تفتح
Labron Sutton	5	November 10, 2020	It is ok
D3s!r3	4	November 10, 2020	Its fun, kinda wish that durability of weapons is higher! But expect that. Game is fun and enjoyable. Worth playing :)
mattvarga26	2	November 10, 2020	To be honest, I don't know if I really like this game, or totally hate it. The gameplay mechanics are beautiful, some of which I am used from similar games like Westland Survival. Base building, exploring the map, crafting, fighting - even classes! really awesome! On the downside, the Co-op is not really thought out well. You should have an option to disable it, and not meet any players. It is VERY annoying when you get to a location, or an event, kill enemies, only for other players to steal the loot from under your nose!!!.... also, upgrading a single piece of wall or floor for 20 boards? seriously? to craft them takes 80 minutes as one board is 4 minutes... WAY too much... I like this game, but I cannot recommend it completely.
mr benyaminac	5	November 10, 2020	بهترین سرور برای ایرانی ها اینترنشنال یوروپه👍
Kieran Patel	5	November 10, 2020	Best game ever!!!!! Nothing wrong with it kefir! Out did themselves!
close no signal	4	November 10, 2020	Nice game
blindfolded gaming	5	November 10, 2020	I love it and i like it bc you can play with friends
Sathis Kumar	4	November 10, 2020	Would be better if solo farming can able to vs solo pvp, while doing solo tomb sudently a group appears, kinda Unfair, not everyone get active team. Plz make a uo Update for that
Chris Taylor	5	November 10, 2020	Fun game with a lot of potential. No energy so you can play as long as you want. I'd love to see an item that allows me to change my spawn point within my home so I can spawn inside rather than way up in the corner.
Random Mist	3	November 10, 2020	Need, When tapped on item it need to show its name and discrption, need to reduce the damage of zombies they deal damage even when the player is far.
Neil Dawson	3	November 10, 2020	Fun game, addictive gameplay but weapons and armour degrade way too fast, literally farm all day for materials to create a decent weapon for it to break after 3 mins of use, with better balancing this game could be epic. * edit: uninstalled, lost everything after update, screw this app.
Kenny Moffatt	5	November 10, 2020	Everything is pretty fun. Less disconnection from game would be great
Veranga Chinthana	2	November 10, 2020	Full of bugs , i lost lots of valuable things coz of that, some of them are paid ones. Good game. Must be corrected
Pongo Cleveland	5	November 10, 2020	Nice
Brandon Clark	5	November 10, 2020	Great game would be be cool if yall put in some scroll scematics for gear and weapons to find in youre next update.
Sarah Hale	4	November 10, 2020	Good but gets boring after a while.
Tyler Hucks	4	November 10, 2020	Grate game but I hate when your first time playing you have to go back and forth to base to up grade your village,other then that its a great game and I love playing it.
Melissa Fortney	4	November 10, 2020	Good
Stacy Blevins	4	November 10, 2020	Great game need more areas
idk panda	5	November 10, 2020	If you guys can do you think you can add a friends list
Paul Austin	4	November 10, 2020	The game is like all the others in the genre however there is real time multi-player now, and your family you build your rooms in quadrants it's great!
mena sik	1	November 10, 2020	Pay to win bullllshit
Mehran Rezaie	5	November 10, 2020	I love this game
Tgp Acidburn	5	November 10, 2020	great game
Berg	5	November 10, 2020	Love the game, only problem I have is how long it takes to get rare items.
Sean Hebert	4	November 10, 2020	It's a lovely game. Took everything I loved from LDOE and even added actual multiplayer, which is huge. The reason I only give 4 stars is the server problem. Besides that i'll be glad to play for the upcoming updates. Just please dear god don't make the mistake of making it too pay to win. Events rewards should be earned, not bought.
Phoebe Odland	5	November 10, 2020	I love this game really awesome and fun to play I'm in a family with a guy called crazyman he is super nice and awesome teammate!!!
Anh Trung	5	November 10, 2020	It good
Olsly Luster	4	November 10, 2020	Great game, made a few friends in it and we all work together well. The only problem i have is the repair table you buy with coins. It should repair durability over time instead of 24hrs set time. Another option would be to decrease the timer based on rarity. It would also be nice to pull it out before it's completely finished but that's not so bad. Its the 24hr wait for everything. I paid cash and really want the premium but I'm holding off till further updates. Great game though!
king sokkary	5	November 10, 2020	The best game ever recommend for any one
Shay Patrick Cormac	5	November 10, 2020	Definitely a Really fun game but the controls and interactions definitely needs more work especially when you have 4 chest Bundles together, sometimes I open the wrong chest Overall really fun, can't stop playing lol Oh yeah, I hope you guys could add an advance settings for graphics, I don't really like Shadows but I want to have a higher texture
Josemaria Loperena	5	November 10, 2020	Best mobile game so far. It is so annoying to get camped by players 10 level ahead of you though.
NinjaB1 •_•	5	November 10, 2020	The game listen to the fans and jcf is da best
Austin Whitt	5	November 10, 2020	Amazing game honestly i reccomend alot u get to join friends and pvp or pve together and u can live together and grow ur home base and also ur own lil city its easy to gain so its not real grindy but its not so easy u just end up super op very fun runs great plz add new stuff anything works great job devs
Duncan Schoonbee	5	November 10, 2020	yes is a cool game 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Scotty	3	November 10, 2020	Well it's trying to be a great game, you can travel anywhere you like without using the old energy system. They make you work alot to build up your base, be better if the resources needed was much less. And your armor and weapons decay fast. You can repair them but takes 24 hrs unless you have money to pour into the game Sadly I work for a living so I can't do this too often Steer away from having to depend on buying and grind and save your money for that car or house
Anh Thu Lu	5	November 10, 2020	Great game
Oluwatobiloba Gbeminiyi	5	November 10, 2020	"I really love the game.... The game is very good, the pvp mode is good and everything about the game is superb.. But it's lacking just one thing, and the thing is the service, the service is lacking alot. I was playing the game this afternoon and it would just pop up 'connection lost restart"" and most situation when it occurs is when am am fighting the enemy and when I restart I would be dead so please work on it."
wolf55 wolfeshtina	2	November 10, 2020	Best survival game ever just play and enjoy it👍 But it must to be have persian language in game and have a chanel in discord for persians ppl. So many time im disconected in game and dead i love this game but i think must rate 2 star until it fixed🙄
No Mina	5	November 10, 2020	Edoo Pro
Greg McCulloch	5	November 10, 2020	Edit: no issue since the newest update.
Tjdagamerk Tj	4	November 10, 2020	Alrightthere are pros and cons to this game but this is the one I don't get the most how come on last day on Earth you can get nails easily but on frostborn takes you I don't know how long but a very long time to get nails and the workbenches all the way up it'll take me a very long time to do this I would have seriously recommending fixing this bringing it down to a lower level.
star maker	3	November 10, 2020	Pay to play game 🌚🌚
Nour Haron	5	November 10, 2020	One of the best storyline survival games

Douwe Van Egten	5	November 10, 2020	Love it. Such an in depth crafting and class system. I can't wait for the horses and boats to become available.
Mark Florence Royales	5	November 10, 2020	One of the best game i played
Kaido 93	5	November 10, 2020	Nice game i ever play in Android.. i'm satisfy.. 😁
Xver Sever	5	November 10, 2020	Very good game.. i enjoyed it
kevin Gonzalez	5	November 10, 2020	5 🌟 but please please put more events!
shiau	4	November 10, 2020	This is one of the most entertaining mobile game I've played in a long time. However it need improvement. Weapons and armour breaks way too easy. And you can repair one at a time in 24 hours. Please make changes, make the Weapons and armour more durable or at least give the option to repair a few things at once.
Beau Diddley	5	November 10, 2020	AWESOME!!
Юрий	5	November 10, 2020	"You wrote ""correctly"" incoRRRectly in the Play Market news))"
Chris Smith	3	November 10, 2020	Great game but there are some issues. One big one is being a solo player. You don't match up with solo families. I stopped playing for a while and I decided to get back into it. 2 min after installing and logging on a family of 4 come in with sledge hammers and destroy my base... Uninstalling again.
matthew smylie	5	November 10, 2020	First game on the phone in a long time I have enjoyed playing. Not my usual cup of tea but I'm hooked
David Velazco	5	November 10, 2020	Super fun
Projekt Red	1	November 10, 2020	Really sucks
Dave Warner	1	November 10, 2020	This game is just too hard. I've tried and tried to survive but to no avail. I have decided to concede to this game. Don't let my misfortune disrupt your effort to conquer the carnage. Good luck 🌹🖕🌹
Hallowed_Knights	3	November 10, 2020	It's a great game but it sucks that the game crashes often and it could be your downfall in the game but everything besides that is great.
Pevlan	5	November 10, 2020	This game is awesome! it's been 1 week since i played this and i am on intermediate playing with maxing all level 1 class and a craft a work bench. Nails is so easy now. Thanks to JCF tips and tricks!
Tim Abresinos	5	November 10, 2020	Repair tables need to have different repair times depending on rarity of item/ amount of damage of the item. Kinda weird wait for a blue tier thats less damaged than a purple tier take the same length of time.
Arnold Ap	3	November 10, 2020	I really enjoy the game although I think the fact that as we level up and find or win higher tier weps, the durability goes by so much quicker on my purple weps than on my green or common. Would there be a way to increase the durability or give us an option to craft repair kits vs buying the one repair station which takes 24hrs or 50 gold to skip, to repair 1 wep/armour?
Joseph Canuda	4	November 10, 2020	This game is really cool. I love it.
Rodrigo Pimenta	4	November 10, 2020	Tive que dar permissão manualmente para o armazenamento -- limpando o cache não funcionou. Tirando esse contratempo o jogo é bom até então, não tive problemas até então
David T	4	November 10, 2020	This game is much more interactive then others especially your energy, food, and water doesn't decrease when you're offline. Gathering items is repetitive much like other games, but, I am able to accomplish some tasks even when I'm offline. Accomplishing certain sites with teammate or others players allows me to be more interactive. Overall, good game.
STRESSBOYZ767Test	4	November 10, 2020	Its good but there still more lag and bugs... And i suggest we can trade with each other in same server
jotaro jojo	5	November 10, 2020	I love it since it doesn't have a energy meter thingy that if it runs out you have to wait for hours to play again it's fun I'm playing it with my girlfriend it's our new bonding time now lmao
Blippet	5	November 10, 2020	This game is like a survival addition of PoE. You can wait for things to craft/cook but there isnt an energy system. This makes travel, fighting, dungeon delving, and resource collecting viable for long periods of time. Your growth is at your pace! Theres PvE, including an area without player contact, PvP, and a very cool party/neighbor system that has your pals live/craft literally a walk away.
joan viajante	5	November 10, 2020	Ok Yes
nanda septian	5	November 10, 2020	Great Story Tellings even used a same platform with last day on earth
Burn Ning	5	November 10, 2020	The game is absolutely amazing no doubt, it feels like the finished product of LDOE with classes, powers and magic. I have no other bugs interactions and server errors thats why I think for now to give this a 5 star.
mAtT RoUx	5	November 10, 2020	I love this game it is complex but at the same time easy it is so much fun 😜
بوعلام حمودة	5	November 10, 2020	Good game

Marwan Walid	5	November 10, 2020	This game has the most potential in all mobile games on the play store I have never seen anything like it. Good job developers
Dj Raven	4	November 10, 2020	So far it's one RPG I can like playing other than my other one I play. You can change what class you are once you have progress through the game. Good graphics and controls. Can't wait to see what events they have. I will change it to a 5 start if they can beat My first dog game
Anna Clarissa Luna	5	November 10, 2020	This is the best survival game ever
Cyriel Grommen	5	November 10, 2020	It's a very fun multiplayer game. Try it for you self, you won't regret it.
killin4fun757 atyourhouse	3	November 10, 2020	3 stars has potental but iteams break way to quick an the $5 item repair bench fixes 1 item every 24hours is ridicolous u buy iteams an u die u lose them these 3 things alone are gunna kill the player base cant rlly casually play need to change tht aspect of the game 5 stars if u do
Inflection	5	November 10, 2020	Ark But Vikings=epic
Empress Min	5	November 10, 2020	I came here because this game is similar to grimsoul.. However, this game is much better than grim soul in my opinion. Weapons and gear dont break as fast, energy is not needed for doing things, travelling around the map takes little time, it actually does let you play with your friends, etc. This is the best survival game ive played in awhile now. My only problem with it is it sometimes lags a lot. Incredible job to the developers and i hope more improvements come to the game.
Ghostalk Entertainment	3	November 10, 2020	I really love this game, but it's so hard to collect resources and my items broke so fast and i don't habe a problem collecting resources cause it's part of the game but the durability is suck!
Eric	5	November 10, 2020	Really enjoyable game. I like the idea of live PVP with actual other players especially defending and attacking bases. The removal of energy was a great idea to not energy lock players.
Black Tv	5	November 10, 2020	This game is awesome but plss give all begginer players purple items
TudoContéMerda	5	November 10, 2020	This game is the best coop game that I even played until now. Please, play the game guys. (É o melhor jogo co-op que já joguei. Por favor, joguem.)

アライフマーチ	5	November 10, 2020	The reboot been happening multiple time a day in main asia server. Can you please tone it down a bit..
2Jank	5	November 10, 2020	I also recommend this game to people. With improvements its a very good adventure, pvp, grinding, time game. A few suggestions. (DEVS) Group system to get familiar with people for families. To kill bosses and maybe have shared loot for the boss? Repair bench before Engineering Bench. Need to think about the community. Maybe add skins to certain items ( Give a Rust vibe for skins?) A improved store for newbies. You add these, I'm sure you wage will increase
Axe CullingBlade	5	November 10, 2020	finally has a game with pvp full loot and beauty UI. hope that game can prevent mod, hack game like grim soul.

1CE KR4K3EN ULT1M4T3	5	November 10, 2020	I love the game it's so addicting I really love it but I really hate pvp when I'm grinding yellow and red zones some ppl always troll and kill me and my team in my fam and it really gets annoying and I really hate the pay 2 win players bc if they buy some stuff off the store they get really strong weapons and it always 3 or 4 shot me and my team but it is a great game so keep it up
Hanz van Baldivino	5	November 10, 2020	This is amazing game ever

iqbal 01	5	November 10, 2020	Good
Molo	5	November 10, 2020	God game. Kinda like skyrim your mom.
nob ody	5	November 10, 2020	Best mobile rpg I've ever played, graphics ain't too shabby either.
Amir Hakimi	5	November 10, 2020	Very good game...i love this game... So far no problem,just bit lag maybe because of my phone...and you should add word like thank you at 'emote' or what it is...
Link 9671	5	November 10, 2020	This game is like skyrim, minecraft, teraria and ark all in one. Love this game and highly recommend it
The GameVenturer	3	November 10, 2020	When i looked at the game, i thought i was going to get a very similar experience like rust, and it is but a few flaws here and there. The game is good, but with a little more improvement i would give it a higher rating. For example, some starting item rarity like fabric, chain and simple items for daily farming should be much easier to get and stacked items that would be better if it's slightly higher or tweaked. But overall its a pretty good game.
Dan Rom	3	November 10, 2020	I got to my camp tried to go in celler and got stuck in limbo. Everytime I open the game I still am stuck in the same pace. Might want to fix that. Its like off the map and everything is black. Problem was fixed. I'm not very far so I can't a great review. They do get back to you if you have a problem. And their fast.
gina fox	5	November 10, 2020	Fun
Dimyell Dougie	3	November 10, 2020	Good for a mobile game. Decent graphics that don't go too far and make the game run poorly, decent combat, good house system and a well lmplemented co-op. However, there are some issues. Durability is a joke. You can barely wear something for ten minutes before it falls apart. You'll spend a good 40 minutes an hour naked. The game is very harsh to solo players. The ability buttons are too small to tap. Hoping to see these issues resolved in the future, the game would be solid.
PandaIsLucky	5	November 10, 2020	Absolutely awesome, I never get bored of this game because the grind just never stops and you get to keep on playing without waiting for anything! Its awesome! It's barely p2w so that's great as well.
VETERAN EUGENE	3	November 10, 2020	Really good game and in my opinion one of the better games kefir has made. Although I feel like weapons break really fast, and in pvp areas we have tomb camper problems. Players will just camp there and kill you with all your stuff and that sucks, otherwise really good game! But now that I think about it...The biggest problem is lag. I lag with the lowest level of graphics and it's a living hell, please fix this it's such a pain. I have died 9 times because of this and it really pisses me off.
Anthony Smith	3	November 10, 2020	Overall this is a good game. One negative is on the Raiding. One man Raided my camp and in 20 minutes he was able to clear out EVERY chest I had in camp. 17 of them!!! Each was full to the brim. I cannot begin to tell you how long it took to get all that product. From gathering to actually producing. It took many hours and days. Anyway, please limit the time for Raiding a camp and limit how much they can take. It's unfair and lopsided and discourages people from wanting to continue.
Niger Paras	5	November 10, 2020	The Game is So Good
fishbowl gamer	5	November 10, 2020	Good experience so far
Ronan C. Gelvoligo	4	November 10, 2020	I don't think about this game but i like it scince i was still playing LDOE and Grim Soul that the pvp in this games is missing and this game came its more interesting to play with your friends,but i concern that all weapons,tools and armors are very fast to loose its durability and i face some game crash anyway when event wil pop up and i enter the game is crashed and quit. I wish y'all fix this immediately. Thank you in Advance
Steven Campbell	4	November 10, 2020	I like the game but sadly it seems the servers are always overwhelmed with players. Making it hard to log on and play during peak hours. 8am PST who knew. Thank you. It does seem to be more stable.
Tech Alpha	5	November 10, 2020	Very very super game download and play fast for become PRO
Dixon Makatura	3	November 10, 2020	To many updates
SalesBoss ClosingBoss	2	November 10, 2020	"The game should be called ""frostbitten"" because every time i play this game i question if it will last due to server costs The servers are bad, and the alg loves for players to die so they buy more merch Only a fool or tool will not realize this However computer programmers are not entrepeneurs and will eventually lose their player base Again i tell it the way it is Seen many great games die off because of a lack off planning and proper moderation Trust me no one wants to be over moderated"
Clien John	5	November 10, 2020	this game is actually a great game, however you can't make your character become stronger with out grinding and also with out joining strong family.. this game is not a easy game for it's really challenging and sometimes disappointing... i will give 5 star cause i love this game and i want to play more so please improve this game handsomely...
Alexson Ajau	5	November 10, 2020	I like this game because i can play with my friend and not spend any energy to go to other location 👍👍
rafael jr mariano	5	November 10, 2020	I look forward for future updates, no force ads, games fair, good farm grinding game it keeps u busy
Mattie Kidd	5	November 10, 2020	Really cool game so far love games like this the only problem I would change if it was me is the game controller settings it's in a bad spot I keep hit the button to say things like help me an pissed off ect some y'all my want to change the next update but other then at so far is a problem for me an it's a really easy game so far so great good well keep playing for sure
Heherson Laguna	5	November 10, 2020	Finally found something interesting, anyone reading this, just download it and play this gaddamn good game
Araxhs Gamer	5	November 10, 2020	5 Star ⭐⭐⭐
Magic Mike	1	November 10, 2020	My vault got reset and i had items i paid real money for in it. Would not recommend this game. (Update: 3 days and no customer support yet)
Rolito Ejandra	5	November 10, 2020	I love this game for team fight
Josh L	3	November 10, 2020	Love the game, but its way to punishing for a casual player... I started playing 11/8 after my wife went to bed and 3 hours later at 2am I'm still on my phone. If you have played Osrs / Albion Online U\O or Eve and enjoy the full loot pvp you will love this game. I spent $20 on coins to support the devs and lost it to battles I really shouldn't have (buggy) or it brakes in 1 map clear (3-5 min worth of content) epic (purple) gear will. Degrade completly after 1-3 pvp fights. 7/10
Seba	1	November 10, 2020	Still wont load up, i did everything. It just wont work, a shame becouse Last Day works fantastic
Kingaj Madakwade	5	November 10, 2020	It is the best game ever love you developers
Itz1MAN01	5	November 10, 2020	Just make the game run smoother on old device's
Pr thakur rajput	4	November 10, 2020	Super game bran up game
Jessie Baker	5	November 10, 2020	Love the game
the plaque doctor	3	November 10, 2020	Its a good game has nice graphics nice controls but the creatures do so much damage but I have yet to die so good luck who ever plays this game and sees this comment
Adam Taylor	5	November 10, 2020	The one survival game that got things right. This game reminds me of Diablo, but with survival, crafting, and base building added to it. Overall, this game is nearly everything I could want. I'd like to see some durability changes. The durability of weapons is ridiculously low. You spend most of your game time using a basic spear, just so you don't waste resources, and blow through your weapons. Most weapons will only last one good run. That's terrible. Other than that, this game is epic.
Curtis Vollmer Smith	4	November 10, 2020	Great game, I just wish there were more to do in your settlement
Yaaxik	5	November 10, 2020	Amazing vikings survival game !
Free Youtube	1	November 10, 2020	My items in my chest are gone
Sanjai Kumar Bojaraj	5	November 10, 2020	Good
Ryan Valdez	5	November 10, 2020	You gotta go.
Oosman Khodadin	5	November 10, 2020	Supper Good
Kash Renolds	3	November 10, 2020	I wish you moved a little faster. Not crazy fast jus a little bit quicker. The slow run makes you feel sluggy. Controls and the menu is all good though. Oh yah and being able to start a family is the thing that makes this game sooooo lit. My girl used to like grimsoul but that was wack. So I started playing this with her and now we have fuun ^~^
Mathew Randall	4	November 10, 2020	Greatest got the reason it's survivor load multi playing n team work
Mithu Maity	5	November 10, 2020	Nice game
Shell Bell	4	November 10, 2020	It's Awesome the game has a bunch of stuff to do and you can play with other people
Brian Weston	5	November 10, 2020	So far the best survival game yet, the base building is on point while making it simple and to upgrade just hard enough to make it worth while. There is a PvP aspect that if you don't like PvP you are not really forced to. The only complaint is the durability on weapons and tools is a bit extreme..I love the idea of decay but this game is set to turbo decay. But other than that it's a great game.
Gabrielneos2_gaming YT-Twitch	2	November 10, 2020	The game is laggy when I walk past my doors at my base, and I cannot connect to my game with mobile data please fix issue then I'll leave a 5 🌟
Sfnx 00	5	November 10, 2020	So far its really good, doesnt have energy so you can play it all day long. Just the action like , crafting take such a long time like a 2- 3 second, but overall its really a great game.
GREAT LORD	5	November 10, 2020	Good game 5 star for now but expecting more from future. Don't make it like last day in earth, for now content is enough but not enough. 1 Need more classes 2 need more crafting items. 3 need bigger map and more locations Its boring to just farming in the same locations and the locations are same looking. You know better then me focus on this game and not on making more games.keep it up.
Dhruva Narayana	5	November 10, 2020	This is waaaay better than other survival rpg games on playstore including last day on Earth and others,I hope devs continue to make this better,the Co op feature is a good addition
dead soulknight	3	November 10, 2020	Love the game me and wife played for few days now and only thing we don't like is the pvp ppl just wait till your fighting then tag team you then wait your body
Mr Kimcheng	5	November 10, 2020	I love it
Storeview By: Lennon Rico	5	November 10, 2020	Nice game, not so hard to play like others that's why this is very nice. Good job on this
L K	5	November 10, 2020	This games graphics is super but multiplayer options make the game better
Andrei Santiago	4	November 10, 2020	I love the game. I can play woth my brothers. But the only problem is its hard to get an mastery point. Im lvl 27 and still not getting the protector.
Suyog Mauni	3	November 10, 2020	I have been experiencing a serious glitch in the game, whenever I travel to the redzone for looting about 60•/• chances are that I die because my avatar doesn't move from the place it's getting attacked from zombie or a player it looks like that my avatar is moving freely without running please fix it I lost too many of my precious loot because of it. But I love the game and concept
Ram Engmawia	5	November 10, 2020	So fun but can you guys fix the lag problem
Gaming_with _Kelv	5	November 10, 2020	Good game
G Clement	5	November 10, 2020	One of the best
BISWARUP GHOSH	3	November 10, 2020	This game is awesome and it become my favourite in 3 days everything is good but add pets and enchantment table which help survivors to enchant their weapons and make it more powerful thanks.
Heino Coetzee	5	November 10, 2020	Its a realy great game. Fantastic actualy. There is only one problem that i have with it tho, the raids are not always an equal match up.
Ardelle Thomas	2	November 10, 2020	So I loved the game but I'm now unable to access lvl 75 account. Keeps giving unable to connect to server pop up after 5 minute load screen. Would love to give 5 stars again please fix 🙏
Agung Putra	5	November 10, 2020	Good Survival Game.. Keep Update withmore content...
Naresh Mewara	4	November 10, 2020	Awsome everthing. Need upgrade in real graphics. And can you guys add voice communication feature in the game. It will awsome. If it is possible. I love this game. And need more location for loot. Please update new location in map.
Kailash Rana	5	November 10, 2020	Best game again by kefir, I'm waiting for more updates, but the gameplay is great ,ALL FATHER ODIN AND THOR HIS SISTER HELLA AS HEL, and when will horses come in game
Vishvaishwarya S	1	November 10, 2020	I humbly request the game developers to not change the durability of items. Every single one of Kefir's games end up with absolutely horrible item durability and half of my time goes in grinding for basic amenities.
Just 'Khai	5	November 10, 2020	So far I don't have any problem, the game just good enough to be played... I think it's a little lagy... that's all, keep a good work
sheikh mohomad aazim aazim	5	November 10, 2020	Nice but work bench is so far and horse is to close
sharavan suthar	4	November 10, 2020	Good game overall But please provide some more ways to earn gold coins
Alicia Ca	5	November 10, 2020	Great to play!!!!
Edwin Toolseram	5	November 10, 2020	Suggest maybe durability of cloths and weapon be longer than currently.
Tony Ripley	3	November 10, 2020	Constantly get booted from the server. A lot of lag. Loose progress in pvp area when killed by others during glitches.
Arnab Sarangi	5	November 10, 2020	Playing this game for first time. It's amazing.
Yoh Yoh	5	November 10, 2020	Cool
Sanchyan Chaterjee	5	November 10, 2020	Amazing game very better than last on earth survival and I have a request to the developers how can I unlock alter of Odin.
Madhuri Iyengar	5	November 10, 2020	this game beautiful i love it
Rock Chesterman	3	November 10, 2020	Keeping up with task and trying to improve weapons harder than you think, but enjoyable
Team Fearless	5	November 10, 2020	Perfect
ŞĆØŘƤƗØŇЖ	5	November 10, 2020	I like the game but there are some character glitches
Anthony Croft	5	November 10, 2020	Hooked from the beginning awesome game play and easy too learn love frostborn!
pratham miglani	4	November 10, 2020	I would give this game a 5 star if the piercing dagger could be crafted
Clinton Tichey	3	November 10, 2020	I messed up and either need to restart the game over or find a way to get wood for the first task, not sure how to do either after using all the wood I had without realizing there was an in game task for it
ROSALIE SICAD	5	November 10, 2020	I luv it
Samir Salihovic	1	November 10, 2020	I usually dont leave comments but had to worn new players coming.. game has decent concept got adicted to game spend 10 hrs straight ahhaha made 2 friends we grinded and died (btw no energy neded) which is fun... Then after log out got raided and all that hard work gone ALL.. dont waste ur time wepons die easy and armor you cant farm high lv players insta kill u.. if u farm u will do so for other high players and cheaters..

Renmun Taiju	5	November 10, 2020	Kefir I know a glitch so can you fix that the glitch is that one day I entered my vault and it spawned me outside the vault

Frank Baluscang	5	November 10, 2020	👍👍👍👍👍
Abram Arciniega	3	November 10, 2020	Moderate
33mavboy	5	November 10, 2020	Das ist gut
Aba Taylor	4	November 10, 2020	So far so good! Started before it went global but not feeling the global-Ness much yet. All I'd ask for, is for the premium to be cheaper, like the Survival guide in Ldoe and for there to be black skin tones available. And not just 1. Black people play too please, and we'd like to represent our skin tone. Also the quick chat/emote options are a nice touch but don't serve well when you're adventuring with your fam. Can we have the option to change the words in the quick chat slots?
Dniel Ctra	5	November 10, 2020	The game is great I hope the devs will add a green zone without pvp because it's hard to farm resource when there's a lot of players in one map
Lye Kork Hung	4	November 10, 2020	Good
Hari V	4	November 10, 2020	This is such a wonderful game! I love playing with my friends! What I suggest is to optimize this game for free to play players too. ❤ This game is so cool! Love you Kefir, for listening to us!
zens killer ps	5	November 10, 2020	Bro i been waiting for this game to release the game is sooo good and finally i and my freind can play together nice job kefir also i play ldoe too hehe
Pawan Singh	3	November 10, 2020	Nothing new as same as before (the last day on earth) some changes should be done like daily getting a new chest or weapons as a daily reward and changes must be done in construction of house and also getting a dragon,bull,wolf,bear as a pet
Mitch Coquia	4	November 10, 2020	This is good its better than last day on earth
finetastic g	4	November 10, 2020	The game is great overall has a great gameplay and is a little campain play type and loved the idea of co-op i can farm with my friends all i want 4 stars cause there is a bug or planed i dont know but workbench is unlocked at lev 40 of district and need for nails is too early in lev 17 of district soo only way ot obtain nails is to farm that is way to hard sooo please check on that
Frozen Spawn	1	November 10, 2020	I been playing since it was released on google play went to log in just now and all my progress was gone. I had level 32 district and I was proud of it all that grind and all the loot I had is gone.
OG Goku	5	November 10, 2020	Played for almost a week and it is a great game. What peaks the interest is playing with friends and thats always fun. But lags a bit.
Gunwant Madakwade	5	November 10, 2020	Best game
Desert Off-Roaders	5	November 10, 2020	Really nice experience. They added the coop system and the district system which others were missing. Deserves no less than 5 stars.
Fernando Silva	5	November 10, 2020	It's a damn good game but why my server not working it just kicked me out of the game please fix .
Aaron Stefan	5	November 10, 2020	Nice game! Keep it up!
william krisnadi	5	November 10, 2020	Good
Taylor James	5	November 10, 2020	Finally a game of this genre and play style with everything that it needs to function properly.
Akash Prajapati	5	November 10, 2020	This game is already so good there is nothing I can say wrong about it so far! 10/10.
Hamza Khan	5	November 10, 2020	this is best game of kefir really
Isagani Cagas	2	November 10, 2020	1st Not a new player friendly less than a day old player forced purchased premium packs then got forces to a raid event and eventually got my base ransacked all my premium item gone in an instant. 2nd no real way of contacting developer for complains specially with force reboot or connection to server lost and after several attempt to re log in, Character Dead/Naked all items gone and when u try to file a complaint it will redirect you to empty page. Not recommended to paying players.
Sarah Darastrix	4	November 10, 2020	The only thing I don't like about the game is the durability of the items. The good weapons and armors are rare and break to quickly.
L S	3	November 10, 2020	The last update keep forcing me to restart the game over and over again, because of the internet connection issue, eventho my connection is good. Pls fix it to get the 2 invisible stars ;)
Emma Franco	4	November 10, 2020	The game is good, but the time producing an item was slow, making this game more challenging. But for overall, this game is good as it sounds like of other games of Kefir. Keep it up GMs.
Alin Vasilachi	5	November 10, 2020	the best game ever
L.A. Mariano	5	November 10, 2020	i love this kind of game . Its not an ordinary survival game.
Mr. J	4	November 10, 2020	I like this game
Saeed Elahe	1	November 10, 2020	Cant Even Enter The Game , stuck in Initializing loading Page At First what To Do?
super brous	5	November 10, 2020	Well done very well done this game has been made very good. Last day on earth it's good but this is better
May Nuñez	5	November 10, 2020	it's addicted..lol
Universal studios	5	November 10, 2020	Hello dear devs I rate this game 5 stars its worth it! Actually one of the best games in my opinion..so what I mainly want to talk about is the protector class...the first rank of the class is hard as hell to get and the only reward is shields blocking 3 times more which is not worth it when you see that the low to mid level shield only blocks 1 damage ..so dear kefir pls make an addition to this class which is 25 more health Coz this class is mainly a tank , it would help a lot and also worth
francis obera	3	November 10, 2020	5star but there's a bug kinda fraustating. when i stuck on loading screen entering a tomb or Odin and got restart message atter a reload im back on my bed empty handed, happened twice on me kinda fraustrating spend minutes clearing a tomb then died on loading screen even without monsters then when i came back there's no dead body to retrieve. Also on Odin happen to me i got Screencaptured. But this time theres a dead body on frontdoor I came to kill boss But died on loading screen 🙄👎
Harsha Sahu	4	November 10, 2020	This game is good but it can be better because one reasone that our health is not continue increase make it atleast our food level about 85 our helth increase to max health this makes game perfact
GOBLINSLAYER UwU	4	November 10, 2020	there's a very huge bug. please help. my ign is FURIPPU.EDIT: i'ght im'ma change my rating cause i have luckyly got out of that mess, but sometimes when its laggy there's a slim chance that you'll teleport out of the boundary in cellar(after entering)
Craftsboy Mobile	5	November 10, 2020	Fantastic, gameplay fantastic graphics are cool this is F2P friendly!
Apiz Vanness	1	November 10, 2020	Play this game for a weeks and i hate it, too many toxic people in asian server. Tq for wasting my money and energy plus my time adios !
Rhais Lilangan	4	November 10, 2020	I really love the game but weapons are very decent to craft and need rare components and if we try to get some rare item's with my friends pro players keep on showing up with there strong wepons and armor u can only buy to get and very hard to craft if your free to play player please make weapons a bit more easier to craft and armors lots of players are struggling please see this problem
Dominic Gomes	5	November 10, 2020	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Max Net	1	November 10, 2020	Very slow, lagging all the time and commands have a delay time to perform 🙄... Fix it or more players will leave
a Marsmallow	3	November 10, 2020	i love it but things break very quickly even purple gears :( it be nice if you could make durabillity longer
иοιя【ノワール】	5	November 10, 2020	finally! a co op survival! thank you so much kefir! now i can move on from durango xD and play with my bestie again
Freddy Ur Papi	1	November 10, 2020	"Like the game a little but this game forces one to buy stuff cuz of the dam raiding all the time I cant get ahead cuz other people buy the raiding supplies and attack ur base and ur base isn't protected cuz once another clan is matched up with ur clan a raid will start and ones shield goes down for that raid . I'm so dam pissed at u guys trying to rob someone . I rather play ur other game "" last days on earth "" at lest there u won't get raided until u do a raid . In frostborn u r a victim ."
Dexter Almorato	5	November 10, 2020	best survival game in mobile
Andre Arien S	3	November 10, 2020	Please improving matching for raid , low level vs high level, and durability for gear is too weak

Vaclav Hnizda	5	November 10, 2020	I want to find a game to play with my 4 brothers. COOP right? Well, to add a random person the invite works fine. But, to add a person by searching there name i had some issues.. eventually I got it working. but the reason I've over time changed my review from 3 to 4 and then 5 stars is the fact that customer support actually works!! And they were fairly quick to respond to my issue and support even though i manage to figure it out on my own.
Tegbir Singh	5	November 10, 2020	much better than last day on earth
CRISTI BUTELIE	4	November 10, 2020	sunt smecher terminator cu capul calculator
Mudasir Ara	5	November 10, 2020	It's good as we know the kefir games and has multiplayer that gives advantage to this game .... But pls add friend mode and that we can invite our friends from other family to our camp ... Like that and game is awsome
Dylan Marsden	5	November 10, 2020	So much better than the rest. I dont have to wait all day to go somewhere, I dont have to play it only once a day and most importantly I dont have to be alone .
Joshua Lyndon A.	4	November 10, 2020	F u dont like pvp system, play similar games without one. There's a plenty of them. Pvp makes the game competitive
Ibiwild I	4	November 10, 2020	30 minutes to download, not finished yet after playing i could change my review After 3 days playing was worth the waiting game is well done, worth to give a chance
Jason Chong	2	November 10, 2020	Pay to win game... Player low level with epic pay item.. no match at all
YARELI QUINTERO	5	November 10, 2020	Buen juego muy divertido
Cathedral Vallory	5	November 10, 2020	I like the game but Items need more durability rather than breaks quickly its really frustrating.
Khayr ThatsME	5	November 10, 2020	good game
steph rae	5	November 10, 2020	Loved there previous game Last Day on Earth. This follows similar crafting/survival mechanics, but Frostbourn has so much more detail. Highly recommend both games!
Koushik Adhikary	4	November 10, 2020	Can i play it on ipad

Derk 67	5	November 10, 2020	Ета игра крутая и как по моему на голову више ласт дея (а еще нет енергии)
林建和	1	November 10, 2020	雖然好玩但一旦死掉了全身上下的東西都噴光了還會被別人撿走真的是有夠爛！
Shivkarthickbala Bala	4	November 11, 2020	very good game
Shawn Smith	5	November 11, 2020	Love the game
pike vena	5	November 11, 2020	I love the game.
Danny Carello	3	November 11, 2020	Im rating this 3 stars because I can never get resources because people take it all which slows progression when im mining ore some random comes and takes it I also am tired of being forced into PVP on a CO OP game PVP is not fun is over used at least give people to option to disable PVP other wise its a fun game until an op played kills you in a matter of seconds
Anime Kings Anime	1	November 11, 2020	I can't rest my progress annoyed with this game
Andrei Munteanu	5	November 11, 2020	Cool game ...is hard but nice
Jacob Xiong	5	November 11, 2020	Breathtaking, please dont add energy, it will completely destroy your great game.
james chin	3	November 11, 2020	Seeing ads all over the place for this and it looks like such a good game. but because its so pvp based and you can lose your gear if you die I just can't bring myself to put time and money into it just to lose it to tryhards. Make it more casual and ill be happy to start playing it.
Chyenne Nimick	5	November 11, 2020	Love!!!
prakorn supasaksutat	5	November 11, 2020	Fun
Richard goodwill	4	November 11, 2020	Good game, just a little bit slow while moving around (the character), if you can make it faster... will looks better i suppose, and sometime...the character slide near an object, such as trees or stone.
Sampad Raj Patel	1	November 11, 2020	Baddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd game.
Blair Akabane	4	November 11, 2020	Do something about the pvp because the damage output of the skill and weapon and put some details about items so less hassle to guess what item you got from unknown.
packsecond	1	November 11, 2020	Keep asking to update when there is nothing to update
Mat Fonsos	5	November 11, 2020	Exceptional game!
just for fan #	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game that's all
Ridhwan Radzi	5	November 11, 2020	This game very good idea

Swift kill	5	November 11, 2020	It is easy but sanctums are too hard
Sam Dunlap	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome survival game byfar my favorite of all time
Royal Phoenix	5	November 11, 2020	Thank to the developer for the help and the game is amazing.
Shahzad Adil	3	November 11, 2020	It is a nice game but there are many things to improve. 1 please add more pve areas 2 durability of items is very low we need more durable weapon armor and tools.. 3.leveling district after 30 is very difficult and there are more than 100 lvls how can players reach there. It need too much grinding. 4.Skills and classes are confusing and not very effective please do some major changes in them.. Material for crafting high lvl weapon or item are very rare we can't find them
ahmed zaky	1	November 11, 2020	I bought the premium bag and 5 minutes later got killed by monster and lost my bag, that's so stupid to buy something with real money and lose it if you got killed !
Mysterious	5	November 11, 2020	Good game!
Hugo Kruger	5	November 11, 2020	This game is awesome
Allen Melo	5	November 11, 2020	good game,. fun to play
Mochi Reign	5	November 11, 2020	Well, it is still in early access. So, it is also expected to have some issues. But the loading screen seems like to freeze up (it happened twice in my case). Other than that I really am having the vibe of a viking and LDOE!
Noah Jimenez	5	November 11, 2020	Love the game, very adventure like. Love the feel of playing coop.with others.
M4chi51	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing I can play an online game with my friends and have fun and help them play my role on team is a healer but it also comes in handy solo because I can heal myself too
karm2exist	4	November 11, 2020	I only have a question is how can i change my name where should i click it's a good game, it reminds me of vikings.
Benaya Milionhart	5	November 11, 2020	Well is a great game and have a lot of potential. But can u add more durability to the weapon? Is really taking a lot of time to gathers the material and the weapon break so fast too :(
xxnothing xx	2	November 11, 2020	Good game but I wish we could gather alone on the non pvp maps because when I get there all the chest are already open thus making it pointless to go there at all
Jonathan Luhembwe	5	November 11, 2020	Best game ever
Mukesh Sha	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game you should try it
Indiana Stone	1	November 11, 2020	A nice game but the movement speed for us is slow. Also why the frick is there a troll chasing me after I had already cleared the same area that I never left. I died twice just trying to get my stuff back but nooo this damn troll follows you around as soon as you enter an area. It was a red zone so yeah I knew the risk but the prob is why was it there when it wasn't there before. Also like any other creature, once you run far from them they'll leave you alone. Just don't download this dumb game
Fernando Alvarenga	5	November 11, 2020	Every time I try to put my username in the character creator the game starts laging and it kicks me out of the game
Jania Rahman	5	November 11, 2020	Cool game for mobile I love it
Arthur Hampton	4	November 11, 2020	So Far I freaking love the game, my lady and I played the zombie one last day a lot back then but never got to play with each other. But now that we can actually play together and grow its so much fun and we love it so much. Love the leveling system for yourself and district, and especially no cap on stamina :)
Jamie Kelley	5	November 11, 2020	Well done very enjoyable and for first time i will be getting premium package
Chris Whitehead	4	November 11, 2020	Dislike the fact that android and ios can't play together, or that you can't even migrate accounts. Please fix, what's the point of bringing it to ios if you can't play with other people that has different services
Isaiah Howett	4	November 11, 2020	I like the game a lot but your items break way to fast
Rahimul Islam	5	November 11, 2020	They finally made a game I was looking for!
Sam Scalf	5	November 11, 2020	This game is grate
Darknight	2	November 11, 2020	Good solid game I'm really liking it..BUT if u don't fix whatever it is that makes my character slide around map I'm going to quit for good. It hasn't killed me yet but very close to it. Fix it please
Rich Allard	5	November 11, 2020	Having a ton of fun, only gripe so far would be the tourney system. Need more
Dragon	1	November 11, 2020	This is a very game. There is an error that must be fixed immediately, which is whenever I access something that comes a download that does not get me out of it. No, if I turn off the Wi-Fi from the phone, I hope to fix a problem because it is very annoying and we cannot play For your information, this was translated into words, so please understand me
Wonder Emmanuel	5	November 11, 2020	The game is super addictive like amazingly awesome, just wished there was a way to make friends with other players not just having a family but having friends with other player maybe a limit of 10 or 20
Andrei Bucur	1	November 11, 2020	Stuck in an update loop
NINJAS KILLER POWER	5	November 11, 2020	This game is cool you can make a team and nahh if you die its ok but i vote for 5 stars all i love is survival game so i vote😄
Luis Dragonorg98	5	November 11, 2020	Aw man lost my progress when i uninstalled it but other than that i liked the game i recommend this game kafir did a good job again i didint have any problems with the game yet
katy sisk	4	November 11, 2020	I like this game but i hate that i cant find certain things.
Sebastian Flores	5	November 11, 2020	Super!
Carter plays	5	November 11, 2020	I love this game alot but one thing I would like to see is like pets but viking style so dragons baby giants stuff like that would be super cool and I'd pay alot of money to get them
Janny Holo	2	November 11, 2020	This game is best.however we can't get any coins from the game. The game did like force player to recharge. Recharge is the only option. Especially repair table. it is very hard to get.unlike other game we can save coins to buy some stuff even 1years or 2years we can make it at the end. This game encourage only recharge.. It dissapointed.player who addicted to play with no job or any money will never get repair table.. This is tyrant game...
To Lo	4	November 11, 2020	Still learning. Seems solid. Looking for help on youtube
Mad	4	November 11, 2020	A really fun game, but when I tried doing a family with my friends, I'm not sure if it works using different brands (Apple and Samsung), cause I searched the person's name and nothing showed up.
Richard Vassar	5	November 11, 2020	Love this game so far! Better than games I've played like it! I think the loom should be available earlier to make clothes but otherwise AWESOME!
Rofif RR	5	November 11, 2020	Please make the server has lesser lag, so I can easily pvp w/ out waiting 2 secs to open bag and teleporting, overall nice game! :')
Josh Fleshman	5	November 11, 2020	Best survival game yet
Paul Narte	2	November 11, 2020	really good game to be honest but i have a question why.. just why do you really have to make the lock pick 3times more expensive to make than the past lockpick for godsake why
RHINOMEGA CORP	5	November 11, 2020	5 stars as long as there is is not too much time waiting invovled.
Nico Garcia	5	November 11, 2020	Can you concider change the durability of the gear in general it brakes right away :-(, The reparation time for the gear should last according to the rarity of the item no 24 hrs for all.
Darren Walker	1	November 11, 2020	Same old stuff, boring.
elyga justkill	1	November 11, 2020	Crash all time need relog every 5min... 1Star
Isadora Miti	5	November 11, 2020	Thishhhhh game ishhhh lit
Mandeep	2	November 11, 2020	Edit: reduced Rating from 3 star to 2 star. Because I downloaded the game again to see if u guys have fixed the issues I complaint about, and found my old progress deleted, even though I had connected the game to google play services. i don't know if this just happened to me, but it really sucks to lose progress on survival games. Sorry uninstalling again
Alec Dobson	5	November 11, 2020	Best game I've ever played
pablo	4	November 11, 2020	nysh✨️
kiaku987	3	November 11, 2020	I would be giving this game 5 stars were it not a skinnerbox game. I hate it for that and the company for that. They've improved, implemented actual coop experiences, etc. But the fact that they just flipped another game of theirs and changed the assets to fit a new theme is disgusting
MadeyKutty Gaming	3	November 11, 2020	Game very good.. But the weapons durability suck game maze also suck... Make more daily dungeon for player, the repairs table also expensive...
Earth Terra	5	November 11, 2020	Just downloaded im impressed and lol I just found out that its the as creators of Last day on Earth
ISnipe4money	5	November 11, 2020	Love it
Au Teck Leong	2	November 11, 2020	is good, but the PAY TO WIN concept is awful. Different level can meet each other together in a jungle or a raid！Plus, the server lags and suddenly 2 people jump in front of me for two times！And i really hope offline raiding would not be an option, this is not RUST, we dont even have the option to raid those who we wanted to！
Vijokaran Karan	5	November 11, 2020	Good game
Crabby cabrera	5	November 11, 2020	I just love the game
Neo Genemir Miranda	1	November 11, 2020	It dosent want to update
lowgray 007	5	November 11, 2020	Alot of fun !!!
just playi'n Games	4	November 11, 2020	It's a nice game but can u add 2 more spaces in the family pls cause we have 2 more friends that we played with on the other games
Kyoma Otokichy	5	November 11, 2020	👍🏾
condorX2	3	November 11, 2020	Nice and addicting game. Two suggestions, give us an expandable vault to hold hundreds of our items. Managing a dozen of chests and remember which chest to find is so stressful. Second suggestion, let us craft in our base without materials in our bag. That's the main reason why I quit Last day in earth a year ago. I don't mind paying a few thousands of dollars to get an expandable vault and upgrade it to hold hundreds of items. Hoardering is my specialty.
N00bkid67 Roblox	4	November 11, 2020	Honestly, great game. Good graphics, good grind. There is always something to do in this game and its very grindy, but at the same time, it doesnt feel like a chore. The game is still unbalanced though and that I can get paired up with high level players and just lose all my loot like that. This is game is sometimes very frustrating. Overall, I give this game the best of luck, I hope the updates will make this game better than it already is. You got this devs!
Holy King	5	November 11, 2020	Very Nice Graphics and Gameplay. Hope there is new class from fighter role, Twin Weaponary (like twin axes or twin blades etc.)
Kaneki_Ken_1969	1	November 11, 2020	Can't play because its telling me there is an update and I updated it yesterday
Itz Tray zee	5	November 11, 2020	freat game.... just need a little more work.. i wish the weapons didnt destroyed after a while though.. i rather it was upgrading weapons than msking the same set of things over again and again...
Rosy Kayrouz	1	November 11, 2020	the game was great at first but everyday i discover more bugs like my character will move by him self and won't stop til i got killed or that other player can raid my house more that once destroy everything (even tho i didn't chose to raid anyone the game chose for me)but when ever i try to attack the game won't let me it show me a loading screen then nothing other time someone would kill me but i don't see them and don't let me start with how fast ur weapon and armor break
Arjun A	5	November 11, 2020	Hey kefir, I love this game playing with my friends... But a few problems... 1, sometimes when I do tombs, the bosses just uses their ability thru walls?! That's a bit annoying tho 2, if u die, then u lose the durability of everything u had why?! 3, (Same problem) you lose durability of weapons very fast!! 4, (Not ur problem 😂) It actually needs a lotta weapons or armours to donate to altar of odin for unlocking class 5, I wonder if there was a friend list😅 Hope you will see this...
Reon Kyle Supena	4	November 11, 2020	Hi!I lost my things in the game and i want to restart my account but i cant find a way to delete.Pls make the button delete account.Its good.
` Myushi	4	November 11, 2020	Good game but eat sht devs
Alan Morris	5	November 11, 2020	Good game love that is coop could have alittle better loot drops is my only complaint
ewwe Dg	1	November 11, 2020	Item so much faster to drop their durability than my shoe in real life.... Purple Item u buy on shop won't last 15 min.. Wow what kind of game is this.. Buying gear just last for few minute
kyle andrei Flores	4	November 11, 2020	The game is awsome i wanna give some 5 stat but the lagging and my teleporting in any place on location even my signal is high and that was causing on my death what is going on???
Vancoure	3	November 11, 2020	Disconnect from server quite a lot. Even though i pick lower server. And im asure u its not from my net. Getting killed because lag from server dc is annoying. Pls fix ur server capabilities
Horror Smile	4	November 11, 2020	One of the best survival game on the palystore as it features class system in survival whichi is very new and fresh concept....-1star for a bit poor graphics
Little midget Gamin	5	November 11, 2020	Kind of like last day on Earth but I still love it, it's so much more in depth and creative
Jon Vasquez	4	November 11, 2020	It's been fun for the most part I really don't like how fast weapons and armor break especially because if you purchase the repair table it takes 24 hours to repair Wich wouldn't be so bad if you were able to repair more then one single item at a time or make the repair table free
Odinson	1	November 11, 2020	It keeps telling me to update the game even though I have the latest version installed.
dave wood	1	November 11, 2020	tedious
Dominador Tan	5	November 11, 2020	I don't have anything to say.... G R E A T
Mr. Random	1	November 11, 2020	Screw ur game... I literally got raided by a family and got destroyed... and lost everything I had... I don't even have a family to help me defend, but got raided by 3 people, f*** this game
Lea Slider	5	November 11, 2020	I enjoy the game, however server disconnect causes serious loss in items when game reboots and now your at camp because you died while frozen, for example: battle ax, purple staff, and some green gear, it is a definite blow to be sure, but powering on. Like I stated I do enjoy playing.
mrityunjay dubey	4	November 11, 2020	This is great game i have some suggestions to this game First please add a feature of breaking weapon or machine so we could get some of it parts for that you can put percentage of success of breaking Secondly please make us manage some of the messages so we can easily talk
The MRat1	2	November 11, 2020	This is a good game, but I don't have my stuff after an update? I updated this I signed back into my account and I Have to restart, I Had months of work, 3 full Weapons chest, 1 heavy helm and chest, and just normal 2 upgraded full cloth chest, And then I had all the other resources that I can Easily get but please, Just give me my stuff back my account on there is called michael And my clan is ~€sï~

Emmanuel Poquiz	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game. I play with my girlfriend. Keep it up. The game has a potential.
Simon Vang	5	November 11, 2020	I like the fact there no need to use energy to travel. Easy to play.
Ryan Harvey	5	November 11, 2020	Great game💪 addictive!
Torn Prince	5	November 11, 2020	It's cool
paradise lover	5	November 11, 2020	A really good game
thiha thiha	5	November 11, 2020	Nice!
Sergio Wilson	2	November 11, 2020	I truly enjoy this game but it's missing so much like there is no option to add other people that are not from your family as friends or allies, also the repair machine takes 24 hours for 1 repair that's crazy if weapons break so fast why not lower the time for a repair. Please fix there's issues and I will improve my star rating. Thank you
Knowledge Of Pandas	2	November 11, 2020	Love the GAME!!! Looking forward for updates, but currently there is a bug that makes me restart the game over and over even though my wifi is perfectly fine. Im stuck and can even get in the game. Please fix this thanks!
Dion Morales	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game i hope we can all get a free backpack haha
Tedd Satur Pularan	5	November 11, 2020	I just wanna have new character pleaseeeeee
Mikey Playz	4	November 11, 2020	Its an amazing game, i just hope u guys let us restart our acc but overall it has a nice concept
Marjorie Adique	2	November 11, 2020	Hope this offline but need wifi -_-
Bambang Soetanto	2	November 11, 2020	I got kicked while playing dungeon due to high population in Server Asia .......
Raizen Rain	5	November 11, 2020	This game is very amazing, no energy required to go other places, you can play anymore you want, it's not like the game it's not like the LDOE there's energy and can limit your game,there's a task that you can do. You will not bored to play, and play with your friends.
Madz Daguio	5	November 11, 2020	👍👍👍👍👍
Armando Mouallem	5	November 11, 2020	One of my favorites, similar to last day on earth
Ardizon Ompoc	4	November 11, 2020	MA SERVER devs. i know you're doing good for the game but . please can u fix the lag at the M:A SERVER i know its P2W game but we the F2P player can manage the game without buying the item .. we also like the no energy system of the game .. devs. i know you're there please fix the lag AND MORE POWER TO THE GAME
Legednary Broly	5	November 11, 2020	This is so good don't read the bad comment guys this game is not pay to win
Igor Plays Games	5	November 11, 2020	Never a dull moment
Frost Bite	4	November 11, 2020	It's a pretty decent game. Although p2w players are overpowered, especially during raids, it's pretty interesting. One problem I found is I can't invite my friends into my family. Maybe its because they are from a different server. If we could invite players cross server it would be great
ARGUING PIGEON	2	November 11, 2020	Its nice... the game gives a promising feel for co op survival... my rating will improve as the game improves... One major Problem is that the server connection. We have a decent internet conmection but it keeps on saying Connection lost.. my character keeps in dying that way.. it needs improvements for server connection... i hope the game dev Improve this experience as for me this is new in this kind of co op survival
Deniesse Tandas	3	November 11, 2020	I cant connect easily
Begie Jhon Bandoy	5	November 11, 2020	ok
Faruk Muhammed	3	November 11, 2020	Hi,You people got three stars because the game is great. My complain is that why don't u people program ur game once and for life for example now horse saddle i have entered the odin sanctum 5 time's i have never come across horse saddle pls is horse saddle even in the game at all and it is not in the game shop so that we can purchase it hun. And ur weapon break easily pls next update increase weapon durability THANKS THAT ALL I GET TO SAY.
Ashley Bloodgood	5	November 11, 2020	Love this game 😊 wish we had a pet tho, one that follows and helps.
Damned Legion	5	November 11, 2020	Great game again after LDOE, keep up the great work 👍
Akala Imsong	5	November 11, 2020	Very fun game 👍❤️❤️👍 love playing 😎 but need more efficient loot....
Heath Rudisill	2	November 11, 2020	Couldn't connect to servers. Too bad for you
Lindleyross Francisco	5	November 11, 2020	Very nice game.. i love this game..
starnetic 777	2	November 11, 2020	This game is fantastic but lvl 3 backpack is p2g plus you need to get the full set. I don't have enough to buy the hole Instigator set. I just want the backpack. Don't even have a problem with repair table because it's free but lvl 3 backpack is too expensive. Just make the backpack itself buyable or make a large savings kit 6 dollars and not 10 dollars. I will give 5 stars if they change one of these methods. You can also make a Christmas deal where the saving packs are 6 dollars and not 10dolr
Mark Dove	5	November 11, 2020	Great games just what is needed a co-op gamer that has the survival content,OMG I JUST CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS GAME and with friends, well enough said.
Abul Ashad Sheikh	5	November 11, 2020	Best than ldoe
Rocky Carson	1	November 11, 2020	Do not spend money on this game!!!! This game is a money pit. Waste.. I lost some items I paid cash for and after weeks of trying to get some kind of compensation for my loss they sent a backpack and deleted my tickets.. absolutely awful customer service next to none. Kefir games are the worst thieves iv ever came across online....
Josip M	5	November 11, 2020	Solid5 Energy removed More doors to be placed Way more balanced Hyped for new updates, LET US SAIL, RAID AND SACK ENGLAND 😂
Joshua Robert	2	November 11, 2020	Good but it should be made clear that combat have 15 sec cool down, I lost my in game stuff because I was not aware when I was trying to escape
Yanyan Nurhidayat	5	November 11, 2020	"Nice game... I like it Do you know chinese light novel ""reincarnation of the strongest swordman""? Try read it... Maybe you will get an inspiration from it The game theme much alike like this game And add some feature if a player die the other player can have this player item"
Mr gamer	5	November 11, 2020	Best game ever
kent paragamac	5	November 12, 2020	Nice game, made me forget wild rift for a bit.
Bonny Torres	5	November 12, 2020	It is fun it can get better in somethings
Patrick Lopez	5	November 12, 2020	So fun to play with friends. my friend recommended this game to me and i absolutely love it keep it up.
Kaka Van Lestat	5	November 12, 2020	Nice
Dickcheny Baidya	4	November 12, 2020	Good game. But it would be great if it was mentioned where to find which types of resources... And their names too... I still worry where to find which kind of things... Got me irritated on this matter which would stop the further in-game progression. Rather than that all things are great just a little laggy...
Ryl Ramirez	4	November 12, 2020	Game is AWESOME Few suggestions: 1) Make it possible to craft things even if the items are inside the chests, in doing so, less time and effort in crafting and you'll know if you have that item or not. 2) please add a feature of adding a friend (i don't know if it exists already, it is no where to be found) 3) items are EASY to break. Most importantly, the weapons. Sure it's not that hard to look for the ingredients in making one but it's a waste of space, I have to bring more than one weapon.
Bachas	1	November 12, 2020	this game is pay to win, if you spend money then you have an immediate advantage over everyine, you can get EXCLUSIVE gear that is the best gear in the game by spending money, if you dont have a deep wallet dont play the game
Kiapon Pon	1	November 12, 2020	Game is not fun. During camp raids you will be paired with much stronger enemies. I got raided by 2 families 4 players each(in my family are only 3 person), they have epic armors and weapons. While I only have basic stuffs. There damage was 400+ and I only have 150-200. No fair match making they got all the stuff we worked hard for weeks. If you die the enemy can loot you immediately but you can't revive immediately to retrieve it. I also bought some packs they deducted 15% more from the total.
Yaniv Kalfa	1	November 12, 2020	Dont bother with this. This is yet another copy of last day on earth that charges you for anything you do.. complete waste of time. More over the control and the general feel of the game is really sluggish and bad.
aaron Martin	1	November 12, 2020	Pay to win sucks
X1M3 GaminG	5	November 12, 2020	This is epic rn

Terry Thomas	2	November 12, 2020	This game was going well started play yesterday ,but I can't deal with wait 5 seconds before exit what is that all about , I've been killed 4 times because of that and lost all my gear
Michael Newman Jr	1	November 12, 2020	"So I'm playing and doing Odin, when all of a sudden I'm kicked due to "" server disconnect"". Lose all my best gear due to their server, send message to developers and still no reply about the incident!!!"
AHMED RAZA ALI	1	November 12, 2020	What the hell is wrong with the server. My character keeps on getting Frozen and teleports randomly.

Alexander Condoluci	5	November 12, 2020	Lvl 200 something in ldoe ready to put some work in this game great multiplayer mechanics wish ldoe was the same
Steven Sanchez	1	November 12, 2020	"Fun game when i am able to load and play it. i get booted from the server alot and also won't load alot times. All ""support"" says is ""check your wifi/isp."""
Сергей Варанкин	1	November 12, 2020	Идиотская система баланса, два места для новичка где можно фармить, но там ничего нет, камни и деревья, в других локациях пвп, куда приходят самые умники, собрать халяву, убить слабых, при возрождении дают оружие и экипировку, только тольку от неё, если у тебя класс персонажа другой, ну да, можно пойти дальше собирать камни и деревья, это же так интересно, а какой толк от того, что ломается очень быстро оружие? Аа ну конечно, денег вам нужно занести, хотя можно и без этого, камни и деревья ждут
Brennan Patrick	5	November 12, 2020	Good
Asiyeh Saberi	1	November 12, 2020	That game Not open for me
Tejiro Tine	1	November 12, 2020	You guys are rip offs, how can I have a stable network and then in the midst of a battle I can't move and then I get logged out to restart and then find I've been killed. I've lost a lot of valuable items cause of you guys. Fix you damn servers 😤 also I changed ratings from 4 to 1 cause I'm pissed now
Mario Cruz	5	November 12, 2020	Love this game. :) I like the co op play and the space for your neighbors because its tough finding an adventure game that has it. Keeps u busy and u never know who and what you'll find. Hands down highly recommended.
biswajit halder	5	November 12, 2020	Kindly allow repair table ( free of cost) every one can enjoy more, love u kafir u make every gamer aspection on top what next 💌💞
Michael Crowder	5	November 12, 2020	Add black and brown skin tones
Subtract Five	4	November 12, 2020	Please keep working on this game so I can make it five star. I really like the idea of a survival game with a player drive economy.
The Undergrid	1	November 12, 2020	There is a glitch that will not let me attack right at the very beginning of the game. I got killed twice lost my weapons and I cannot start over from scratch
Tyson Alixandra	5	November 12, 2020	Good game I love it a lot like ldeo but Viking times awesome.
Sgt Mike	5	November 12, 2020	Amazing game. Item durability should be reworked though.
Eimantas Lisus	4	November 12, 2020	Awesome game, something I've been waiting for so long. Right now don't have friends to play with, but starting out solo ir really fun and challenging. 4 stars because game randomly crashed during fight with a giant, logged back in my camp naked, rushed and luckily got back 10slot bag I bought for cash with other items, though 1/3 of it's durability is gone, not a game breaker, keep up the good work and fix those random crashes please.
Aries Julius Fernando	4	November 12, 2020	The Game is wonderful.. this is what i was looking for on LDOE thank you kefir.. looking forward for more things to craft.. like a place were you can display ur favorite armor and where u can display ur favorite weapons.. Edit: wish you guys put like a daily reward system.. like a calendar style where players can get items everyday they log in.. that would be wonderful.
Matt Cummings	2	November 12, 2020	"Can't play unless I'm on Wi-Fi. Even with 4 bars lte and low population server. Also the beginning 5 tabs while loading, needs the first sentence in ""Riding Animals"" fixed. Would give at least 4 stars if I could play because what little I've played on Wi-Fi seems great."
Teresa Harrison	1	November 12, 2020	Fix your game and stop auto my range weapons when I am not using them
Jacob E	1	November 12, 2020	Clone game of Grim Soul. I get stressed out trying to keep up with limited durability of my items, limited inventory space, hunger, thirst, limited resources around. I bought the basic weapon pack with real money, limited durability! Controls and graphics are meh.. So there, proceed if you dare.
Lemuel SABA	5	November 12, 2020	Addicted to the maxxxxxx
Merik Flips	5	November 12, 2020	insane
Michael Ofria	1	November 12, 2020	I'm I've got 80 some hours lvl 41 log on today and got killed in my own camp 4 twenty minutes... Everything I have gathered an saved is gone ... What is the point of playing a survival game when someone higher level than you can just jump in and take everything you have gathered? Come on game designers stop sucking.
alex che	5	November 12, 2020	Great game to play!
Mike K	3	November 12, 2020	Fun till you get stomped over and over by a pay to win.
Quan Walker	5	November 12, 2020	So far the game is actually pretty great and I like the environment the game play as I actually very easy but I wish the family can be able to be a lot more than just four people but all in all the game is actually great everything is very smooth and the resources is very easy to get.
Mørk Sjæl	1	November 12, 2020	Its a brillaint game and ive been playing since you released it, its come far. Here is why i gave 1 star. Pushing prices up for gold when its so hard to grind for rare items is just greedy asf... keep in mind that countries that dont earn $, £ or € cant afford what might seem like small increases to you. Not cool. Ive stopped buying gold and wont until the price drops. Still, great game.
Baifa Goh	1	November 12, 2020	game speed slow. durability not lasting. i purchased some items, but it is DROP when killed by mobs. ths drop system super sux, it drop ALL items. will not buy anymore for this game.
Boss Crig	5	November 12, 2020	Loss of words. Superb game!
Beverly Dennis	4	November 12, 2020	The new update has it glitching so bad I can hardly play. I love the game but I'm dieng left and right due to the glitching. I just glide into the enemy. If it's not fixed I'm gonna have to stop playing. I would really hate that
Stevan Mijailovic	1	November 12, 2020	It lags to the point where it moves you all over the map and guess what, it stops when you are killed which means anything you have gathered is lost and you revive in the camp with no loot, no equipment, no nothing... This happened 3x in like 30 mins. Not willing to wait for any updates in the future since now it is unplayable.
Tri Utomo	5	November 12, 2020	look so familiar graphic game Durango
Mad doc	5	November 12, 2020	Nice co-op game, still looking for some good family but over-all this game is great.
Shenna Suchy	1	November 12, 2020	Can't run game
Jim L.	4	November 12, 2020	Its a great game. Except for no where to heal up other than eating something. It would be good if you can sleep to heal. Plus the amout of healing ratio is off you kill an animal and the meat you get from it doesnt heal as much as cooking it.
Likaa Aoun	3	November 12, 2020	Family traitors ..the family thing is unfair .. i got betrayed..its hard to choose people..there must be some hard restrictions or laws for betrayal or somthing .. there must be some option to help us finding good people ! Since its essential !!
Pressurize -	5	November 12, 2020	Kinda like rust Fun
Jose Orozco	2	November 12, 2020	It wont connect to any server.
Kat Fisher	5	November 12, 2020	So far I am enjoying this survival game above all others. Repair tables!! No other survival game offers that.
Akshath Baruah	5	November 12, 2020	The game is the best...no doubt...but now when Im opening the game, it tells me to update but there isnt any .... Please fix this.... EDIT: Yessss, I reinstalled the game and didnt lose my progress....and now it runs smoothly...Thank you Kefir! EDIT: Hey Kefir! When is going to get released for android? Overall this game is great👍👍👍👍👍
Aloysius Lim	5	November 12, 2020	would be nice to be able to delete progress and start over.
Patrick Vance	5	November 12, 2020	Great Game
Jennifer Juarez	2	November 12, 2020	The glitching is awful. It keeps notifying the wifi connection isn't working and I have to continously restart the game. After downloading it for one day, I install it for another day & just tried it out today. Still bsd and I know my wifi isn't the real problem.
Carlo Visey	5	November 12, 2020	Great game
Rayford Wright	5	November 12, 2020	Great game so far.
Teeborg	1	November 12, 2020	Pay to win. You can raid anybody's base as long as you pay for weapons and armor in the game. The free player gets robbed in a second from the guy who pays for the game and have unlimited resources. I spent 40 hours collecting stuff in the starting zone and spending all those resources fortifying the walls to level 2. However this was not a problem for the pay 2 win player who came in and broke through all 7 layers of defenses and chests.
Mc Torres	5	November 12, 2020	Nice
Jo Mari Pinga	4	November 12, 2020	so nice but have to give it four stars, it is so laggy even my wifi is strong and my tablet has nice specs but still it is a great game so far
Vichu K Vijayan	5	November 12, 2020	Good game
Sexy Sausage	4	November 12, 2020	The games ight I guess. Tho it's still very incomplete. I think the durability system should change a bit and some crafting recipes should be modified a bit. Also I think the games a bit tedious to understand at first. Like I go on the the Frostborn discord group quite a lot it order to understand stuff. So yea overall 9/10 game would recommend
Yung Shino	5	November 12, 2020	After having bad connection issues for a week I was finally able to log in for the first time and boy was it something me and my brother spent hours gaming on this exciting adventure the wait was worth it
Valerie Hamilton	5	November 12, 2020	Love the game but everytime I go thru the green door in odins the game tries to reset me for like 20 mins needs to be fixedd!!!!!!
David Demo	3	November 12, 2020	I wholeheartedly want to give this 5 stars and I know its a fairly new game. But wow it takes an incredible amount of time to gather resources. Alot of items by chance and items break way to fast. It also takes way way to long for specific things to craft like maple planks or smelt like copper ore ETC. OR fixed on the fixing table.I cant wait to see if in a few months. Maybe will be updated to help speed these things along. I cant imagine spending days grinding away to lose it all in 5 min raid
Ramon Flores	4	November 12, 2020	Grind game but very good I mean it is an rpg / multi-player
Orion Gaming	4	November 12, 2020	The game is extremely hard for new players. Metal is crucial but farming it is impossible because there just so many creatures packed in small area and they get agro so easily, forces you to fight them to loot. When I try to fight them it is impossible to fight them because so many at the same time start chasing me. When I run away they just dont leave me alone, they keep chasing me and while running, as I told 'too many creatures packed in a small map', everyone gets agro and start chasing me.
Matt1984	5	November 12, 2020	I'm liking it
Dovah King	1	November 12, 2020	Don't recommend at all . The raiding is ridiculous and one sided . Favours only the rich and powerful. Does nothing for new players except being robbed and raped. Spent hours and hours to collect and produce resources only for 1 raid after another to clean me out. Don't waste your time like I did. Kefir sucks
Jose Maria Jimenez Gutierrez	1	November 12, 2020	The game is great, with nice graphics and so, but after the last update it continuosly crashes with (apparently) lost in connection, delays in actions and very slow moves. I died 4 times already due to this issue. Please fix this, or it will be uninstalled (such a pity, because it has a lot of potential)
XDBoy Gaming	5	November 12, 2020	Nice game.. add new new features.. & plzz add to developer clan mumber voice...
Gaurav singh	5	November 12, 2020	"I love this game but I don't know why it is not opening after 2 days of gameplay it is all time saying "" you lost connection from the server please restart"" even I reinstall it 2 time , please try to fix it . I hope u will try it. Thanks"
Dhen Reyes	5	November 12, 2020	love the game esp the multiplayer. we're peaceful family, please add somehting like raid system in ldoe where players need to do some quest before he can raid or be raided. we just love farming. thanks for this wonderful game. 😆
Bear Hawkins	5	November 12, 2020	This game is awsome but need a party aspect
matthew simpson	1	November 12, 2020	This game is so slow everything is in slow motion.
Animesh singh	5	November 12, 2020	Having family thing in this game is best thing....., Till now no complaints
Hakuna Banana	5	November 12, 2020	All mobile game is pay to win, but its not very significant in this game, i hope they give us free player more advantage so we can play it continuesly
Nugget Nugs	5	November 12, 2020	Nice. But hard to get loot. I die again and again. When u visit new place u always die. Overall , nice game.
Rosalina Cruz	5	November 12, 2020	Cool
Simp Slayer	1	November 12, 2020	Matchmaking is HORRENDOUS, new players get invaded by P2W ppl and get immediately annihilated.
Lilly Mason	1	November 12, 2020	Incompetent Devs. P2w trash. Dont play any games by this company. Second most retarded game company on the planet. Avoid this company like it has Corona. You'll be glad you did. Pvp Abuse to the max. Devs dont care they only want your money. Kefir is a bunch of retards and always will be.
Apostolis haronides	5	November 12, 2020	Slow pace game as solo. Some items are hard to find. If you find 2-3 players its the best rpg to play. It has everything . Enjoyable gameplay-graphics-strategies. Hf:)
Leo Maranan Madolid	2	November 12, 2020	how to save your progress on google account, current progress cant be played onusing a different mobile device
Nathaniel Bayaua	5	November 12, 2020	Still giving you 5star even though theres a bug in the quest on ACT V. on killing on tombs. Please fix it. Im stock
Daniel Wentworth	5	November 12, 2020	Love this game
Tushnim Gangopadhyay	3	November 12, 2020	"There are flaws here that need to be fixed. The game keeps logging me out regardless of my network strength. Also, the crafting tree is melee-first. I purposefully chose to start as an archer to see how different this game is from other Kefir entries, but I have to play with a spear until I get the resources for a bow, which are not readily available. Same for the staff. Why the melee focus in your ""rpg""? If we can be a mage or archer at the start, we need their gear and resources to make them."
Ali MadDog	5	November 12, 2020	Love it
Random Tutorial	5	November 12, 2020	I love the game..just the kind of survival coop game ive been looking for. One thing, though, please add a feature that enables us to repair weapons.
Isabel Race	5	November 12, 2020	Keep it the same it not to hard
Adam kono	4	November 12, 2020	I really like this game and it's fairly new so it does have kinks to be worked out. In my opinion kinks that should be addressed is primarily weapons. 1. prolonging the weapon breakage. The wood spear seems to have the same half life as an epic weapon. 2. Your level and crafting weapons is no where close to scalable. 3. No daily login rewards. 4. A repair table that is 5$/10$ cash cant remember and 24 hr repair???? Not worth it btw. BUT, IT IS A FUN GAME. LOTS OF GREAT POTENTIAL.
Jeff Johnston	5	November 12, 2020	Excellent
Frances Mead	5	November 12, 2020	Enjoy the game so far. Could do with a little longer resistance in clothing and weapons. I play other games like this and I enjoy this one too. Still learning this game so can't really complain about anything yet.
Brandon Howell	3	November 12, 2020	Good game but weapons break 2 fast and finding copper ore and Maple wood is far 2 much effort wall upgrade are far 2 overpriced by asking for 10maple wood planks just for 1 wall.upgrade seeing as u can only find 1 tree at the redzone 2 farm
Lif	2	November 12, 2020	Good game but is getting bugs now ive reached a certain lvl. Keeps disconecting me from the internet.
Anthony Juliano	5	November 12, 2020	Loving this game
Aryan Marota 10th D	5	November 12, 2020	I love this game I waited for it and it is finally here
Best fights scenes	3	November 12, 2020	بيض
AxinDemz WhoWokeWho	5	November 12, 2020	Fun, grundy, pvp is a blast
Rebecca Harvey	4	November 12, 2020	I understand it's a pvp, but I don't like the fact that Im open to being raised even if I have never participated in a raid myself. I think if I'm not participating in raids I shouldn't be open to being raided myself.
Alexandra Quiaoit	1	November 12, 2020	after the update october 29 your server still sucks. always lost connection . loading it take a lot of time im a data user but other online games no problem. LIKE I SAID OTHER ONLINE GAMES LIKE MOBILE LEGEND, WILD RIFT HAVE NO PROBLEM. IS ONLY YOUR SERVER IS THE PROBLEM. CANNOT HANDLE TOO MUCH PLAYER IN 1 SERVER. IT CAUSES LOSS OF CONNECTION, SLIDES GLITCHES, LOADING TAKES MORE TIME. I EXPECTED THIS IS GOOD GAMES BECAUSE IS P2W.
Tyler Davis	4	November 12, 2020	The game is fun and very interactive, the only problem is that the devs take awhile to respond, ex. Trying to get a refund. They say to go to Google play and google play tells me they can't do it and to contact a developer, but I've yet to receive any confirmation or denial of said request.
Aleh Ber	1	November 12, 2020	Another moneysucking game, no surprise.
Sywa Youtube	4	November 12, 2020	Its a good game, but can u adjust the time entering the vault its kinda slow
PUNISHER x	1	November 13, 2020	Would love to play this game,its never worked for me yet,keeps saying change server and won't load,sucks
Anthony Miller	5	November 13, 2020	It is a good game
Stackhouse	4	November 13, 2020	Other players run up to me to lick a fight. I turn around and kill em. Ezpz
Cecil Reed	3	November 13, 2020	This is the best survival game ive played so far...and ive played amost all of them...but i give it 3 stars because there is a terrible glitch in the system..your character jumps and slides around and you lose control of the fighting, walking, running, everything...and in the heat of battle this is a killer...when i stop moving around, my character is dead and i lose all the rare armor, weapons and anything ive collected...very frustrating when your fighting with a group...if this can be fixed its def a 5 star game...any chance on fixing that?..it also freezes a lot...maybe upgrade your servers?...
DonGiovanna Juanita	5	November 13, 2020	5 stars well deserved. I am lev 20 and nothing bad to say about this game
Axom DISUKE	5	November 13, 2020	Nice but how can I add my friend I'm searching my friend name and it shows Player not found Plz help
Nitesh Oraon	3	November 13, 2020	Give my money back or give me premium
C Galvan	5	November 13, 2020	In developmen, I look forward to the finished game
SFP Spartan	4	November 13, 2020	Amazing game only thing inwish I could see is the info on items well in the inventory so I no what it does
Jaztineee	4	November 13, 2020	Game is great but the durability of the items are too low, maybe increase them by 10%. You should Increase the rate of good loot in yellow zone tombs and also, P2W players have a really big advantage.
Aditya Kumar	5	November 13, 2020	U can get scammed by your family and be careful...thank u Dev's for helping
Marie-Maïssa Gaddami	5	November 13, 2020	Aprés quelques jours de farm le jeu est intéressant
Andy B	5	November 13, 2020	great game
Tyler Wagner	1	November 13, 2020	Pvp is broken.
Muhammad Balkis	2	November 13, 2020	It is fun game but the PvP need some changes. One raid and you loose everything and have to start all over again.
Radu Catalin	1	November 13, 2020	very disappointed the game is not balanced between the players all are snakes camping so they can steal everything you have you can not enjoy the game unfortunately it is very stressful and unfair
Liam K	2	November 13, 2020	"its ok. except for getting the gear YOU PAID MONEY FOR STOLEN DURING A ""RAID"""
Ian Moody	1	November 13, 2020	Don't bother.as soon as it opens it freezes, can't go no further
Arc	5	November 13, 2020	I love it. Though there's a lot to improve, so far, i like how the game works, it's not that hard and it's not that easy either, keep it up!!
no need to know	5	November 13, 2020	Good
Patricia Wall	5	November 13, 2020	I love games like this surviving playing with friends I really love it
Emmanuel Huang	2	November 13, 2020	Sudden disconnection happens frequently and causes my role died accidentally....also my friends in another continent suffered.... It's really disappointing our favor for this game...
Jamar Johnson	5	November 13, 2020	This game is amazing
Hossein Sadeghi	3	November 13, 2020	What the hell is wrong with the connection? my net is 4G but it lags and kicks me out frequently.FIX IT!!!!!
Shin Danieru	5	November 13, 2020	Fun to play, me and my lil bro love it sooo much.
Spiddy YT	5	November 13, 2020	Just a OP game but need to add voice chat option with family member it will become my favourite game at all.
Bounty 727	1	November 13, 2020	This game will n er be as good as last day on earth

GOLD LION BOI	5	November 13, 2020	Best game ever!!!!!!
Robert Bruner	5	November 13, 2020	Very fun
Kazou Satoma	5	November 13, 2020	Good game
Vladimir Juranovic	5	November 13, 2020	Great
Chris Floyd	5	November 13, 2020	The game has everthing. you can do alot
Ackeem Lawrence	5	November 13, 2020	Needs improvement but loving it.
Pedro Simões	5	November 13, 2020	Amazing game. Keep the good work.
Aquilles Ramirez	1	November 13, 2020	good game but pay to win lol, makes me sick! LOL what strategy? pay you a lot to get stronger? pay to wins will just wreck us every time, doesn't matter what we work hard for, paid items always wreck the grind items, get over yourself!
Logan Lamb	5	November 13, 2020	Great game just need to have a way so you can swap goods between family members
alexis oconnor	1	November 13, 2020	This game is trash nothing but a cash grab everytime u die u lose everything u have so you have no choice but to spend money the game it self is great but the cash grab makes it trash would have never downloaded if i knew
Abdo Refaey	5	November 13, 2020	Wow just wow!
Gio86 Bolota	3	November 13, 2020	It laggs too much I lost all my item because of that lagging cuz i get killed fix it or many will leave
Dopezzzbob	5	November 13, 2020	Good game ..
Joe Biden's Lost Marbles	1	November 13, 2020	Pure cash grab here. I get durability. But when, like all survival games, you get an offer to buy the good backpack for $2 which has a shelf life of a couple of hours of playtime?... Hard no from me. I havent played 'em all, but I do believe this is a first for durability on a backpack in a survival/gather resources game. Trash.
Cat Xray	5	November 13, 2020	This is if you took all of the games similar to this, but only took the good parts, and removed the bad parts. Ex:energy.
Sedrick Clayton	3	November 13, 2020	Hello, your game is a really fun experience but you need to add more skin colors. As a black man i find it affensive to not be my color.
Tony Snow	1	November 13, 2020	Wow...Spend money for some cool gear just to die and lose it. What a rip off.
Kobayashi Senpai	5	November 13, 2020	This game is great ive played alot of last day on earth by these creators and I gotta say love there games plus I dont lose as much energy as last day on earth
Yoichiro Akioka	5	November 13, 2020	Good
Carlton	2	November 13, 2020	I don't like that I can't make a black character. What's up with that?
Kenneth Hernandez	2	November 13, 2020	Edit: Scratch everything I've said. The 48 hour incoming raid is sorta a joke. Especially on solo players I mean I have to battle 2 people from a fam alone? And there's nothing I can do because they've didn't accept peace. Ldoe is still the #1 despite the energy system. I want this game to dominate the #1 spot but it's a shame really getting griefed every 2 days is a pain in the ass. So I won't play this anymore. Goodbye
Jonny556er !	4	November 13, 2020	Generally I enjoyed the game but when someone can profit off of your misfortune so easily and then when you challenge them to a fair fight to get your stuff back and they just run away it's not fair. I would definitely prefer this if it were a single player game, all my progress was lost because of one person.
Barry Hayden	5	November 13, 2020	Good game sofar
Johnnymagilt	4	November 13, 2020	Its a really good game but i dont like it that players can raid you even when your offline.
Bobby Wayne	5	November 13, 2020	So far I absolutely love this game phenomenal game play survival at its best
Andrew Almaraz	5	November 13, 2020	Pretty decent game.
gamez zone	5	November 13, 2020	Good game
Mahir Shahad	5	November 13, 2020	I am addicted
david sertimer	5	November 13, 2020	Awesome
Maude Weremyer	5	November 13, 2020	Love it! Did drop $ did not regret.
fizi hasdi	4	November 13, 2020	The game are almost identical to game Last Day On Earth but, the developer added skill to the character. The player can change class whenever they want, which is not really challenging. This game also almost identical to Albion Online. This game is sandbox game, Albion Online also sandbox game. Except, Albion Online has a lot perks, skill, weapon, and classes. This game(FrostBorn) are more focus on gathering than fighting. Albion Online are balanced game.
Ian Erdman	1	November 13, 2020	The forced raid option is unbalanced. Being paired with player at a much higher level and having them destroy much of your progress is not fun for me. Be given the option to raid other players and therfore be raided would be nice
Josh Bugs	5	November 13, 2020	So fun download it it's great 😌
Jv	5	November 13, 2020	Cool game, i like the style too, it's like playing skyrim but on 2D haha, but can we have like a night mode? Also make every class don't have the same stats, what i mean is this. Hunter have different stats like movement speed and how far can it see through the map and his instinct surround it. Warrior have more deffences too and yeah more. I want to tell the developer alot but the space doesn't fit all of my comments. Love the game! I hope the developer see this, please, for once, read this.
Saad Ali Mafooz Ahmad	5	November 13, 2020	That problem happens after ios release but i complained in discord and my game is wroking fine but player and mob teleport from place to place
Ken Phan	5	November 13, 2020	It is good, but i do have a problem, when I try to log in, it says that I list connection, but my internet is fine. Can you fix this
Chris Adkins	5	November 13, 2020	Great game but you get put in a death loop on the dens of warriors on the first stage. And the damage doesn't role over if you die the monsters reset too and you can't win once you die and have no way to heal fast enough
introvert gaming	3	November 13, 2020	Cool game disappointed in the lack of darker skin tones though
James Q	1	November 13, 2020	Was having a blast playing your game, got about 4 hours into it had a lot of resources gathered and all of a sudden the game crashes on me. I open it back up and the game forces me to change servers. I'm in North America so I click on that server. Once I do it forces me to start over, complete wipe, even my in app purchase. Absolutely ludicrous, don't waste your time or money on this buggy mess until it's fixed.
Dex Caliber	1	November 13, 2020	Ive tried and tried to get on a server but, that was just not in the stars.
Christopher Digma	5	November 13, 2020	well to be honest im a player of lodr for me this is much better u should add atleast a story for this game i rather play this than lodr :)
FALCONXBROWN	4	November 13, 2020	This game is so much fun but the lag kills the fun for me. The servers are not very good it's so laggy that it's unplayable. Fix is needed
Gabriel Saucedo	4	November 13, 2020	Great game but it is a little choppy, sometimes the hit registration doesn't really connect but yet again it is an early alpha build of the game. There is some bugs that might occur during the playing. I'm excited to see what the game becomes to be when it's finished, I loved the other games these people made. I hope the coding is easy for the devs, great people making great games.
Taiga X Ryuuji	5	November 13, 2020	Need to improve the graphic
Somangshu chakraborty	2	November 13, 2020	seems good at first, but its a very time consuming game , play only if u have at least 2 to 3 hours daily . i had studies so i left early
La Hm	1	November 13, 2020	The game freezes after the initializing bar fills. Unplayable.
Araz Sadeqi	5	November 13, 2020	خیلی باحاله ولی خارجیه و فیلتره ولی اگه خواستید بیاید باهم بازی کنیم حال میده اسمم YURI تو سرور خاور میانه قاره وایکینگا
Henry Kruse Palad	5	November 13, 2020	ganda laruin parang nasa stone age era ka talaga.
Ling ZhiLong	3	November 13, 2020	True the durabality go down to fast and the gear that i bought it cost me 20.99 bucks amd in 9 minit it broke i a second
AikawaAyumu123	5	November 13, 2020	Fine game but needs to rely on purchases to be strong early.
Willy Ray	5	November 13, 2020	I Died too often. Which makes me wish i have a reset option😆 but overall its great Co-op Survival RPG
Michael Quinto	4	November 13, 2020	nice but the character is too small hope u add some zoom cam and rotating cam and also add pet
Jay Spurlin	2	November 13, 2020	Take away the forced Raid participation and some of the vicious pvp, and this could be a 5 star game. Maybe allow players to just turn off the raid part if they're not interested and work instead on the building part? Of course raiders pick the most rare things to steal so then you have to either spend hours of your time wading through the random number generator to replenish items - or spend real-world money - and it just becomes frustrating. Would be *great* as a Non-pvp game.
Dr Zah	3	November 13, 2020	The idea of losing durability of your items is such crab idea. Also pvp isn't fair, because you will find player lvl 100 pking players lvl 2 or 3. One more important thing, is losing all your items when some pkers will kill you or monsters. Anyway idea of the game is good but it needs to fix what I said above. I hope developers will do something about that. Best luck
Chad Hutton	5	November 13, 2020	I just started tonight, can't put it down. Great game so far.
Photato King	5	November 13, 2020	A fun gane, just wish they're is some kind of system where familys can combine together or something like that?
Zura Khutsishvili	4	November 13, 2020	Exellent game, but it become a little bit routine while upgrading the camp
Allen R. Cortuna	5	November 13, 2020	Lag to much. Need optimazation for low end devices like My device j2 prime(samsung). The loading screen takes 2 to 3 minutes. Pls fix this this game has great potential. Update: I will wait for the next update. I hope the game is more stable for low end devices for now i will give you 5 star.
Nico Pitogo	3	November 13, 2020	Resources are extremely rare for 2nd tier(only one tree/one metal node in respective zones of which only locations). On top of that the zones are heavy pvp which is ok but make more resources available especially since with that have a stone beast chasing you.
Zombie Gamer	5	November 13, 2020	Played a couple other survival games made by kefir... Found this the best one ever... Great job... Keep it up
FaithFull One	1	November 13, 2020	EAST EUROPE server lags all the time cant even play. My internet is just fine but server 3 days now lags like crazy.
kingstewy	1	November 13, 2020	Game just sits on the initializing screen. Changing servers does nothing.
Thaddeus Wozniak	4	November 13, 2020	Great game. My only complaint is that when you buy something like a backpack for 3$ and then die, someone else can take it. I understand that's you should loose SOME gear, but to lose ALL of it!? and to lose your backpack is disastrous. You basically start completely over running back and forth to camp unless if your district level 28 or above! Why would I spend more money on good gear if you loose everything you bought in a single death??? A response would be appreciated. Thanks
Finness D.	1	November 13, 2020	Terrible Dont play this money hungry game that gives nothing. Take this game off the playstore
Gian Binuya	4	November 13, 2020	Please make walls and floors moveable.
Rohit Naik	5	November 13, 2020	Best
Rafael Capule	5	November 13, 2020	Awesome game, i am looking forward for new development,
Mao Stalin Crisostomo	5	November 13, 2020	Pay to win
Thomas Hand	5	November 13, 2020	Great with friends
Mr. Loverboy777	5	November 13, 2020	Love it
Wearld Whouber	1	November 13, 2020	My review was deleted. Extremely suspicious. The game quickly becomes pvp focused and extremely p2w. Anything you pay money for you will drop and have stolen when you die to the whales. This is the worst kind of p2w I have ever seen.
Abdullah Ali	3	November 13, 2020	Good game but bored easily
Muhammad muzaib	4	November 13, 2020	The game is fine but there can still be improvements made. For example, the repair table takes too long to repair stuff even if the item is at 99% durability. Some resources are too scarce and weapons run out too quickly.
Cloudbogos Mc	5	November 13, 2020	I don't know iam just rate
davidfb kokaljfb	1	November 13, 2020	Sucks mostly grind which would be okay but then there is lots of laggs and i lost all items and gear and contact supp on which they reply ever 2 days and in the end a week of no answer and then they say they cant do anything about it...lol a joke...but if u have lots of cash and time this game is great
paras park	5	November 13, 2020	Really good so far. I hope it stays this way..I want to say that this particular game is easy and player friendly..you will have many opportunities to loot gear and ofcourse craft one..the co-op mode is legendary..it has subscribe or buy market for faster lvl up. Even if you die dont worry the game will reward you often for your courage to explore new territories (dont abuse this it will not work everytime). Its a fun game to relax and play with your friends or in a solo mode.solo is kinda hard.
Caitlynn Revill	1	November 13, 2020	Game crashed and failed to reload so I reinstalled it with plans to join the server again. Game says it saves the server info, but that's a joke. I had a level 17 character, full family, level 18 district, and a nice sized base camp. All of that was gone without any explanation. Honestly, I wouldn't care that much but this and their past games have ruined the chances of me ever playing another Kefir game for a good while. Edit: Game Settings request from them didn't work! Thanks for nothing.
Darryl Porter	5	November 13, 2020	SKOL!! XD lol I love the game and respect the viking concept... I do hope you make it easier to add friends and allies and most importantly we should be able to raise wolf's that can protect homes while we are away...
devaka decosta	4	November 13, 2020	I would love the game, if there is a better storage system like when you open one box you can open all the boxes by swiping left to right and name the boxes with unique names. The graphics are awesome hope we can get more an auto arrange in the elements in the boxes. The game is the best if you fix these features I mentioned. Surely I will give 5 stars away if so
Vulcar Dela Vega	2	November 13, 2020	I love the game but still, i feel like i will just play to get dissapointed. Why? Purchasing players has sure advantage examples: repair table - P2W players needs lesser resources unlike F2W Very rare weapons/armors - one of the most stupid thing i saw in the game is that very rare weapons is available at shop and i feel that if P2W players dont need to grind anymore Suggestion to fix this: 1. FREE REPAIR TABLE -24h for F2W for purchasing people; 12hrs only 2. Remove Vr weapon on shop
Daryl Casem	2	November 13, 2020	I'm downgrading the stars to 2. When the game first launch I could easily load from world mad to location and location to tombs but now the loading time takes forever which is not good specially in pvp areas. I'm waiting to load the location for so long only to find that after the loading screen, I've been already killed by another player.
Bramono Adi	1	November 13, 2020	When died all inventory gone.. same like LDOE. And super slow gameplay.
Dziesevituo Mere	2	November 13, 2020	Always loosing connection.
A031 Priyesh P Puthran	5	November 13, 2020	Amazing game came here form leke not dissapointed
ramon sanchez	3	November 13, 2020	Game is great but took you this long to bring it to be available for my country making several overpowered players already there, that made me give this low rate.
Royce Rickson	1	November 13, 2020	I lost a lot of items because of server problem..died literally 10 times with valuables with it..even though my connection is stable I still get connection problem
Ujwala Pardhiye	5	November 13, 2020	Very good game compared to last day on earth
PRO GAMER	5	November 13, 2020	I love it.. this game.. easy to play addictive game
nux khan	5	November 14, 2020	amazing coop gameplay.love it
XSaber Lazinec	5	November 14, 2020	Pls remove the pay 2 win things to make this better.
Jonathan Bingham	5	November 14, 2020	Good game but I bought this pack with the for 15 extra Items, after a few times of going to collect wood it lag which has happened before so I had to restart it and when I did there was these two monster attacking me a dragr and a wolf and I died and lost everything especially my 15 extra item bag, I looked too see if I could get another on but it's to much and I'm not even guaranteed to get one. So if you guys can contact me pls I would appreciate it and if you can fix this I'll give you 5 *.
Nordlys Sørlys	4	November 14, 2020	I love this game but took a star down because in the Asian server, the population is high, so I got informed by the game to change the server. When I tried to change the server, it said that I would have to start a new game. This is not very helpful when you have already progressed in the game a lot. So I would like to inform you devs to please fix this and let us transport our game data to another server if the current server is facing any issues.
Stephen Morgano	4	November 14, 2020	Great game overall. I think the tavern might be bugged though. Only gives 1 task/quest a day even though I got it to level 2 which said +5 tasks
sritam kumar	1	November 14, 2020	Always getting ping issues even in best network connection 😡🤬 beacuse this issue I uninstall the game. Full mind fu**ked up if u play this game.
Randall Lubash	2	November 14, 2020	At first I like the game. Not a bad multi-player based app. It takes a bit to get going. However, I don't belong to a family or even have a diplomacy table and yet out of nowhere... boom a raid. All of a sudden I had all these families attacking me. I'm solo right now and even the raid system says it matches you to similar families, but I'm not in a family. Needless to say I lost my ass. No warning at all. Good thing it happened right before I put money in. Now they have another empty account.
Alexander Whitbeck	5	November 14, 2020	Fun game not over punishing good learning curve.
Mythical Legend	5	November 14, 2020	It's great open world game to play with friends
H Bolat	5	November 14, 2020	Great Game
Ben Nuno	5	November 14, 2020	Addictive
Pablo Nuño Buxeda	5	November 14, 2020	Great graphics, great story, great game play dynamics. Only to point out that the tasks are not being completed correctly in Secret Grove, despite this last update says they do.
Tarigan, Zefanya Ekin Suranta	1	November 14, 2020	Fuxx
Ahmed Eldesoky	5	November 14, 2020	Perfect
Blue 64	1	November 14, 2020	The Developer is paying no attention to their Customers everyone, just go play a different one like this instead, save your Time, Money, and Data for a Dev that actually cares what you think people.
Kyle Picard	2	November 14, 2020	Forcing my character to retarget to a new enemy during a fight is a cheesy tactic to force casualties. This game is about grinding and gathering resources and sometimes the difference between life and death is as simple as a new enemy tanking for a weak one while both deal damage. Stop forcing target changes or better yet, implement a player targeting system. This is a serious, nearly game-breaking flaw. Upon playing further, the lag is awful too. If you lag in combat you're wide open for AI.
Yuuki Yuuki	3	November 14, 2020	I really liked the idea of the game and I also wanna play it but then there is just one little problem... Just because of that I deleted the game and don't ever wanna play it. I wanna reset my account on the same sever but I cant do that.... If that's possible I would love to play this game and invest time and money on it.
Oliver AD	4	November 14, 2020	Good game like it graphics aren't brilliant even on best graphic mode but overall a great game
Steven Denbo	5	November 14, 2020	I'm writing a review for a game which a rarely ever so. It's overall entertaining Your not punished for dying.
Jose Perez	5	November 14, 2020	Its been a lot of fun. Grinding adventure, resource gathering, tomb exploring and a crafting list that would make Bob the builder jealous.
Eyad Gamer	1	November 14, 2020	I was on raid and the internet get bad suddenly 4 people attacked me and im only 1 online in the Family, they destroyed my all house, looted all my chests, Shortcutly i began from the 0 point, Weeks hard work is gone.
Edward	1	November 14, 2020	Dying in this game lose your curent equipment at the place u died and the settlement ppl can diplomacy and took everything from u other then basement stuff enjoying it earlier game and felt long run will be left disappointed for sure we die lose the equipment thats too harsh for punishment and offline ppl or way richer player can rob u easily this game u nid to pump in lots of money for increases offline measures of defs against player attacks ur settlement offline and rob u its blantly dumb
ItsXnet	2	November 14, 2020	Trash
Dejan Dakic	5	November 14, 2020	GOOD
Ankit das	4	November 14, 2020	Multiplayer mode is just awesome .I THINK you should introduce the raid and other events in last day on earth also
gaming with DX	5	November 14, 2020	Veryy good game
Richard Lane	1	November 14, 2020	This game has features that the others don't, families which is you join random family of 3 others and you can raid other families and the class system. Lots of classes to choose from.The bad part is the pvp. When you go to a area its is pvp or pve. You get stuck with 3 other players of various strength. Most people won't attack you if you dont attack them. The horrible part is when you get in a lvl with a high level player that kills you in seconds. They just load it and kill you. Not worth it.
A Google user	5	November 14, 2020	Really like the game enjoying all apects so far
Ant T.	4	November 14, 2020	Super lame getting raided by teams when you are a solo player. The matchmaking for raids needs to be reworked so you dont get screwed as a solo player. Solo players Beware!!! Also I only get raided offline at night never during the day when im playing.
Trip Legg	5	November 14, 2020	Been having a lot of fun so far
Daniel Calixto	5	November 14, 2020	Nevermind the game is great I was able to fix the problem I had by myself
we wqq	5	November 14, 2020	great
Scott Coble	5	November 14, 2020	Built up a ways, lost it all. Did it again LOL....am built up a ways again, wish me luck
Twonk Donk	3	November 14, 2020	so far so good, had a massive bug when i went into the basement which stopped me playing for a day and then lost the desire but believe theres something potentially exciting here
Treyarder	1	November 14, 2020	Absolutely rubbish game, can't do anything due to equipment being destroyed stupidly quick, then try and get my equipment back but only to fail, what's the point in grinding for all this good stuff, to only have to do it again, cause the equipment you have worked hard to get isn't good enough, DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS
Damian	1	November 14, 2020	"Still can't load game over network. It's been 14 days since the game last loaded. Yes, I cleared my cache and restarted my device. My connection is good. Every other app I use, incl. other games and streaming services work fine. Clearly ""turning airplane mode on and off"" (suggested by support) hasn't solved the problem. A lot of reviews with the same issue. I will update daily until resolved. NA server. Galaxy S10. 4g stable. I don't have wifi. That's part of the point of mobile games."
fortnight Hemze	1	November 14, 2020	It sucksssssssssss
Taylor weng	1	November 14, 2020	Too much to write...archer class unbalanced as fk, crafting complete shht(impossible, need too many items to find that is 10000000% luck), upgrading complete shht(impossible), need nails to get copper and maple, yet need maple and copper to get nails... Can go on and on for crafting Anything above tier 1 just have to be the luckiest son of a btch on the planet...only plus is multiplayer
Sh E eN	4	November 14, 2020	Nice game
Robert Youtz	1	November 14, 2020	This game is fun but the curve when other players attack you absurd. You work days to gather the stuff you need then go to collect more and someone higher comes up and kills you and takes all your work and you are with nothing again.
Duper SG	1	November 14, 2020	I spent so long getting loot and progressing and used my best stuff on a raid and died and lost everything to money spenders
Julia N	5	November 14, 2020	Love this game! Played LDOE before and love this one even more.
Matthew Hillesheim	1	November 14, 2020	The game needs work. My game reloads when I try to go into the lower dungeons of the sanctum and tombs in the resource zones back to the main map not connection issues. I can never find any maple trees in the places they are supposed to be in. Cant progress in the game if I cant find the resources needed to actually progress. When I get to thoes areas I have to run right away because people just sit in the area to kill players that go there to look for those resources they need. Frustrating
DarkArts	5	November 14, 2020	This game is freaking awesome
Fachry Hamid	5	November 14, 2020	Extremely fun but hard to grasp
Jacob Morgen	1	November 14, 2020	Had lots of loading issues
Aleiscia Hart	3	November 14, 2020	Why am i being raided by other players while i am not online? I dont think thats fair ..Its a constant circle with no progress we worked hard to find the things we needed . Then we get sent a camp to raide and the playeres WERE ONLINE i told the dude i wasnt going to raide i just wanted to see.. hopefully this will be fixed... it would totally be worth 5 stars but being raided without us being home isnt okay at leasr let me defend myself thanks for reading
Willard james	5	November 14, 2020	Am loving this game, however since magic is a very broad and versatile skill set. I don't believe it should be limted to only being able to use it while having a staff equiped. Another thing is the leveling system. Instead of going the typical path, many take with this kind of game, You should make a effort to make this unique and different. I strongly suggest a in depth leveling and stats system. Similar to elder scrolls and demons souls.
Wolve XD	5	November 14, 2020	Awesome game very fun ^-^
Sylvester Yagami	3	November 14, 2020	So far so good but its having connection problem. Hope this will resolve
ׂ	3	November 14, 2020	Would love controller support.
John Bacon	5	November 14, 2020	Gets glitchy sometimes moving you around has occurred at least 5 times have gotten killed twice and lost my loot. Love the game other than that
Chris Ramos	5	November 14, 2020	Definitely great graphics and amazing in every way pvp is definitely thumbs up
Jordan Hardy	1	November 14, 2020	DO NOT JOIN THE DISCORD!! Everyone on discord is trying to get you to join family to gain chest access so they can steal all your loot. I've seen it happen and have had it happen to me now. No moderation in discord to combat these scammers. Update: got raided by a single guy in all purple gear (you can buy it) and he took my entire base of loot. If only I was willing to she'll out $50 I could have kept my progress. Shame
Po Feed me food and ghost hunting	5	November 14, 2020	Very fun and great game to play love the graphics dungeons just about everything that is about this game except for the part where I have to pay to playbut seems to be getting more and more easier now sound when you first start out in the game
Suluh Jati	2	November 14, 2020	My courier can't proceed to the next quest. In fact all resources are complete
Justin Pabillore	1	November 14, 2020	Still have the issues about the reconnecting of the game even I have a good internet connection.
Tyler Durant	5	November 14, 2020	It's good just keep grinding
Chettah 2	5	November 14, 2020	Good but great😃!!
Gerald Hinoguin	5	November 14, 2020	Your game is good but I hate my dad
Daniel Pirozzi	5	November 14, 2020	Jogo bem interessante com sistema de terreno de casa com amigos, invasão de propriedade, classes pra trocar a hora que quiser, e tudo de graça nada de pay to win. Super recomendo! Só não dei 5 estrelas pelo fato do delay/defeito nas lutas, pareceu meio travado e sem graça.
Ken Ramos	5	November 14, 2020	Hey Guys! Great game! I just have a suggestion about Raiding. I wish there is a Ranking for Family. Cuz, just now we have been raided by players with level 60 while us is level 30. We are totally wiped.
tik tok ke fans	5	November 14, 2020	This is amazing game but add more item and weapon and tamed dog
Ashley Patterson	1	November 14, 2020	Only works if you're connected via wifi, will not connect off of your cell phone service. Don't download, not worth it.
Somoj jokzz	5	November 14, 2020	Well this is the best of all, no energy ,nonstop PvP with other players thanks
D.A White	5	November 14, 2020	Decent game. Careful you die you lose what you have. And if there are people around it may be lost
Kalob Da Panda	1	November 14, 2020	I want my god damn money back. You advertised the monster slayer pack for 450 coins and claimed it was player locked but that was a lie because only the backpack is. Had I have known this I would've never spent any money on the garbage. I spent actual money on a set of armor that was stolen by a troll player literally 20 sec later when I went to raid a tomb, and then he continued to grief me in chat with it I want my 10$ back. Don't download this game its a trap.
Blake08 FT	2	November 14, 2020	I went to an event in the world map and then I fought some mobs then suddenly got disconnected from the server (MainAsia)which has been a major problem but then when I reconnected and spawned I was at my base naked and all my loot disappeared.. I went to check the last place I went but there's no corpse.. So that's it.. I hope you fix that.
Shawn Rolan Baniqued	4	November 14, 2020	Good multiplayer game!
Roqueto F. Libago	5	November 14, 2020	Very excellent game
Chris Cave	5	November 14, 2020	Amazing love the game
K. R. Marple	4	November 14, 2020	The game is an improved version of Last Day on Earth which is great. LDOE was an awesome game but it was a super grind after a certain point. This game seems to have tempered that down and also gave a real MP feel. I wish however that you could have a friends list on top of your family. People outside of your family unit (4) that you could communicate with, trade with, work together, much like you would if you had a nation in real life.
Alexis Coruna	4	November 14, 2020	I love the game but the weapon and armour are long last at minute and its very hard to find rare weapon but they easily break . Sorry for putting 4 star because of that issue but I love the graphics,control,house and raiding system
mark ryan lariza	5	November 14, 2020	I really love the game... BUT in PVP in the dungeon we can't kill the other player.. They're very annoying because they just looting without fighting the boss.
Verastegui Nicolas Brian	3	November 14, 2020	I can't play because the servers are full. The game makes me wait to play. It will be great if you can fix this issue.
Surya S	5	November 14, 2020	Fantastic game
Brendon Page	4	November 14, 2020	Love the game really fun to do play both competitive and not. progression system is awesome I only seem to have one problem with the game 1: should make raids optional cause I have been wiped a phew times had everything taken had to practically farm everything again making me I higher level everytime it happens then after a week I get matched with someone that wipes my base cause I am really high level and getting matched with people that are pay to win Please fix this I love the game
Asif Mondal	5	November 14, 2020	Good need more improvement
queen,king,ace,jack adventures	5	November 14, 2020	great we played with my cousin you can even join family
Mark Pegler	4	November 14, 2020	Everything about this game is great so I would give it 5 stars however there are only 2 issues I have. 1) it tends to lag or be glitchy when you are playing so it will move your character around the map like a pinball in a pinball machine, then when it's finally done lagging either you are dead or close to it 2) when I usually prefer to play after about an hour or so of playing I get booted from the game saying there are too many people so It wants me to go on another server and i don't want 2
S Suraj	5	November 14, 2020	Op
jannatun nayem	4	November 14, 2020	Fantastic game. But finding some items is extremely hard. If there was a library where I can get info about where to find what, that would be better.
Rain Villapando	4	November 14, 2020	The game is great but I have some problems. 1. The family should have a co-leader to do some of the family actions like initiating a raid and offering peace or war on the diplomacy table but cannot kick members. 2. The skill should have a cancel indicator. 3. There should be control customization. 4. There should be a craftable furniture that can repair items (the repair thing on the popular district or new heim is too expensive.
Irina Novgorodtseva	1	November 14, 2020	Love the game, love love love it, however all of a sudden, it started glitching, as soon as I start tye game, the angry mode doesn't last the usual 5 seconds, it goes on and on and on, I'm not able to interact with objects, I can't leave locations on the map:( please, fix that.

DJ M.	4	November 6, 2020	Great time killer! Truly amazing. It is fun, but the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the paper airplane prank. The control sensitivity is too high, thus making it very difficult. Once that is fixed devs, you can count on 5 stars!!

Forest Bosley	1	November 1, 2020	6 levels, 4 ads. Ad every 2 levels and viewing an ad willingly doesn't bypass this. Namely, viewing the 'bonus' ad didn't save me from the ad at the end of 2nd level.

Alpha Leporis	2	November 10, 2020	Too much ads 😐
kyle dismuke	1	November 11, 2020	Game play was rated low because of the adverts. You also cannot play this in airplane mode. If the ads are removed entirely or allowed to play in airplane mode then I may try this game and adjust my rating.

Barry Harding	3	November 12, 2020	Great concept, good artwork, good sound, good gameplay. My only complaint is the game has crashed or froze when I was being rewarded with new characters thus losing them before the process was completed.
Leonard De Laure	1	November 12, 2020	Too many ads
Candace Pool	1	November 12, 2020	Freezes very often
J MESON	1	November 12, 2020	TOO MUCH ADS. TOO MUCH ADS. ENOUGH WITH CONSTANT ADS AFTER EVERY DAMN LEVEL.
Alex Meyer	1	November 12, 2020	My biggest problem with the app is sometimes when I'm trying to draw, nothing happens and I'm having to rub the screen really hard to get it to register. That totally ruins the game since drawing is the whole point.

beno244	1	November 12, 2020	To add heavy
Michael Denham	3	November 12, 2020	I was having a time of my life until the game started glitching out and started repeating levels at level 154. if you failed the level normally it would just start you over at the same level but at level 154 it started changing the level after failing to other levels I've already completed. even after I succeeding the following levels would be once I have already completed.
Chun Kit Lam	1	November 12, 2020	Ads ads ads
Flávio Abrão	5	November 12, 2020	I've seen people complaining about the ads. My advise is to never play any mobile phone games then and go play PS4. Remember, whatever is free, you're the product, not the other way around. it only becomes the product after you pay to eliminate the ads, this being said, let's be honest here, this game is funny and super fun to play and you should appreciate the efforts it was put by the developers so you can physically interact with the environment of the game. I loved it.
John Mayhew	1	November 13, 2020	All the reviews are correct I took a chance and played it, the reviews are pretty much spot on way too many adds one add for every 2 levels you play not a good game despite what it looks like, I advise you don't waste your time on this one.
Tanbir Rashid	1	November 13, 2020	Way too many ads, you cannot even turn of data/WiFi to reduce app. No no, you can't even enter the game without wifi

Rafael Wolf de Goes	1	November 13, 2020	Ads, ads and more ads. Horrible gameplay.
aiijo 0	1	November 13, 2020	"It's a cheap ""unity asset flip"" grade game, don't expect anything at all regarding its quality Where it crosses the line is when it offers u to watch an ad to unlock a new character They type out ""if u loose it, it may be gone forever"". What it does is reinforce ""fear of missing out"" to make you feel like you must watch an ad to not miss out 🤑 The fact they abuse this psychological effect by blatantly projecting it to the screen is disgusting and reason enough for my bad review."
Mike Lewis	1	November 13, 2020	I had ads in a row totallying up to 4.24 minutes.

Both modes are cool. But more rooms are needed. This is not a very good game compared to other games. But it is a good game. We need more rooms and people to improve it.

Zahra yusuf	5	October 28, 2020	Brilliant! I like this game so much and I am glad that I am the first to review it and I am not only the one to play even my brothers and cousins like it, thank you 😊
Howard Channell	1	October 28, 2020	The controls are so loose that by the 3rd level it has already become too difficult to be considered a casual game, sucking most of the fun out of it. Also there are too many ads and nothing to spend the diamonds on.
Vamsi Krishna	2	October 29, 2020	The sensitivity is soo much i cant move in straight line
Max fuller	1	October 29, 2020	Another Voodoo game, another insane overabundance of ads. Don't bother.
Ashley Hale	1	October 29, 2020	This game is way to sensitive you can't grab nothing

Justin Glennon	4	November 4, 2020	If you're saying the controls are too sensitive and the game is too hard, consider the fact that you might just suck
Elijah0	1	November 4, 2020	Just another excuse of a game just to watch ads and there is a ad every level or when you die and the controls are way to sensitive
Tory Bryant	1	November 4, 2020	Is no one gonna talk abt how you spend half the game collecting diamonds and theres no way to spend them
Directorio Latinfania	1	November 5, 2020	Way too many ads
Harold Pruitt	5	November 5, 2020	Fun fun fun fun no sound tho
yoshimitsuiix	1	November 5, 2020	"Controls are too glitchy and the ads are extremely excessive. 30 second ads(unskippable) for every single action? Wish I could rate ""0"" stars."
Uldrick Leon	3	November 5, 2020	Just as the add made it out to be. Had an add right after the first level. Not even a minute in.
Dèangelo Anaya	1	November 6, 2020	The game is so laggy the controls suck, how can you mess up moving a character moving left to right? And too many ads 👎🏼 dont waste time you can't get back!

Mark Lewis	1	November 7, 2020	All the Ads, terrible controls, and underwhelming amount of actual game play to ad ratio. Truly another terrible mobile game.

PHNX Mystic	1	November 8, 2020	Game's to ez Need to work on controls
Hess Djilioni	1	November 9, 2020	Glitchy, lots of script failure. It made me win the lvl by losing, then i just fell to the ground and it was stuck like that
Joi McClain	1	November 9, 2020	Terrible. Too many ads. They give you gems in each game but there's nowhere to spend them, they're just pictures.
Steve L. Wilson	5	November 9, 2020	So far great... love that the audio doesn't override what I'm currently listening to
joshua winkles	1	November 9, 2020	Got to the third level before glitchy controls came in and i couldnt control my character to make it through.... how does that get past testing to release

The.man.1.million	1	November 12, 2020	I really like this company, and the concept of this game. But the game controls are way too sensitive, with no setting to lower the sensitivity. Please lower the sensitivity and I will give 5 stars.
Bobbie Bryant	1	November 12, 2020	Dont waste your time with this wack game.
Christopher Benoit	1	November 12, 2020	The game has no incentive. There's no purpose for the rubies. There's no reason for ruining. The game doesn't even get harder.

Pug Judge	1	November 13, 2020	Ad base game. (A ad base game is where a game is made with in 20 minutes and they load it with ads.) Voodoo is the company who made this game all of their games are ad base. I recommend going and getting happy mod it allows for ads to be removed and for u to play the game with out ads :).

Ryan Richmond	2	November 13, 2020	Too many ads, just like every other game.
Donald Hill	1	November 13, 2020	Just another low-effort ad-infested game the company made for the sole purpose of making money without caring about the consumers.

Level duration is 10-15seconds and every after level advertising is 20_25 Second.. I don't know why game is created is that for entertainment or is that for advertising.. so m going to delet this game..

TheValkian	2	November 10, 2020	The soundtrack is just awful, terrible doesn't match the game at all. Cant even skip anything for thr life of me. Not the mention the animations are just only little good. Like 2/5 scaling. Not enjoyable to look at.

Inferno Tauro	1	November 10, 2020	The animations are corrupt, the special attacks don't look that good, the names of the characters are not that great, and all the animations are bad ( like the first double ultimate the giant sword is all black with out texture, and thats the same with all the animations and explosions.) Get that fix, and change the names of the characters.
Jeff Herron	5	November 10, 2020	Wow nice game controls a little confusing at first til u get to auto but in all I like it.

Marisa Barr	5	November 10, 2020	I've been waiting for this game to release. Good graphics, Gameplay, Mechanics, Unique Character Abilities and Story so far. Though still have a lot to learn about the game, would be nice if it had sort of a Create your own Character feature... But not complaining. Overall Beautiful Game!
Norad ZX	5	November 10, 2020	So far so good. I like graphics, music, gameplay. Yes, some things are similar to other games of this type but this one got some positive twist to it.
Christopher Rodriguez	5	November 10, 2020	Played for fourty minutes so far it is wonderful.
Sadbrains	5	November 10, 2020	The graphics on this game are absolutely wonderful! Recharge rates are actually reasonable for a gacha type game for once. So far this game has been perfect and was worth the wait! Do not play this if you want to have a life.
Davion James	5	November 10, 2020	Love it
Blakesavager 101	5	November 10, 2020	I love the game and there are no bugs and runs very well.
Seth Uricheck	3	November 10, 2020	"The art is good if you like a comedic style. Numerous English errors (""possability,"" spaces after ellipses, deceptive text changing between first and third person) detract from enjoying the game. Otherwise, same fare as all games in this genre, a story you can play through, random character summoning, unreasonably high prices for the transactions."
Faith Starr	5	November 10, 2020	So far so good! Loving the game so far! Just started so to be continued! :D
Shae Monroe	2	November 10, 2020	All models are stolen and palette swapped from other games, identified a dozen from the GameCube era. First twenty minutes are incredibly boring. Doesn't get much more interesting after that. Don't know why this game was hyped so much.

Vixifairy	4	November 11, 2020	it was a hard choice to give it a 4 star, but im still far too early in to give it a 5, there are also a few issues with the gacha system that i just despise.
Jacob Gonzales	1	November 11, 2020	Server log in problems already what a joke dont release if its not actually ready you money hoarders.
Riviting Wolf	2	November 11, 2020	I can't even load the game....the game looks fun and it probably is but please fix it my phone is fine but your server's are to slow
No clue what i am	5	November 11, 2020	The game plays well on low end devices and looks really good gameplay wise it nothing super amazing but it give you room to min-max with the fun effects and combo moves and story is solid from what I've seen so far
Hell Cat	5	November 11, 2020	Loving this so far. The game is easy to understand, and control feels good. Characters interactions are great.
Casey Adams	2	November 11, 2020	So yeah I get that it was just released. But it won't log me in on any account. If it continues ill just uninstall the game in general
Touhid Sekh	2	November 11, 2020	Servers are live, but I still can't log in, it's just sad
alejandra dominguez	5	November 11, 2020	Good game but it doesn't let me login agian it says im loging in but it stops
Jin Xiong	5	November 11, 2020	Its alright.

rikukid 44	5	November 11, 2020	Very good graphics easy to understand controls
Tony vaquera	5	November 11, 2020	Very well developed game!
Avenger DX	5	November 11, 2020	Good game so far, you have a long tutorial. For people who know these games it's the same, for new players it's nice.
Walmart shipping	5	November 11, 2020	Good game
Mateo Rahming	5	November 11, 2020	So far a super fun game
Aaron Nava	1	November 11, 2020	I can't get past log in page. It says its logging me in but then just goes back to log in its a vicious cycle. Please fix game looks awesome.
Aki Senpai	4	November 11, 2020	I don't know it's look like any others pay to win game but I will give it a try to see
Andii Lanning	3	November 11, 2020	Got a notification that servers are up and ready to go but I can't get past the log in screen. I hope this is fixed soon. I'm looking forward to playing it.
Hana cho	1	November 11, 2020	I CAN'T ENTER THE GAME
ROHAN	1	November 11, 2020	Unable to login only in this game.
Noucheng Vang	5	November 11, 2020	This game is really cool a lot of different game usually don't do this.
Doodle Time Animations	5	November 11, 2020	Great game, it makes me sad that people are leaving bad reviews ALL BECAUSE THE SERVERS WEREN'T UP IMMEDIATELY! I love the voice acting cute character designs. All around enjoyable!
Kim Lam	1	November 11, 2020	"good units are blocked by a Paywall system. You can't summon banner unit with free tickets however you can get the ""premium by doing event and you can only collect enough for a single 10 pull. Either that or you pay up with your wallet. This is a very much P2W game with no hope for F2P to actually compete on the same platform. Will edit if the game changes over time but for now only 1 star"
Säd Pilløw	5	November 11, 2020	Thos game id me of the best ot runs great on my phone Thank u for this amazing game I wanted to ask can i help this game grow I have 2.5k followers and id help by purchasing things in the game

Jose Berrios	2	November 11, 2020	I had fun playing it for a bit but now it dosen't let me log back in to play.
Militaru Alexandru	5	November 11, 2020	Good
Dentariunoux	4	November 11, 2020	Pretty good so far
myron james	5	November 11, 2020	Cant get to log back in and its the first day its really sad i was really enjoying it
Daniel Park	1	November 11, 2020	Firstly, there are huge login errors with the game. There is a countless number of people who are having login issues with Facebook, Google, Twitter, and as a guest even though they were given hours and hours of setup before the game was fully released. In addition, the people who did get into the game found that your game's source and images were basically copied and replicated from other games. I initially thought that this game would be good, but I cannot give it anything above a one star.
Amber Sweatpants	1	November 11, 2020	"What a joke. Can't even play. Didn't care about having to wait for the servers but the fact it just keeps popping up ""logging in"" only to stay on the tap to start screen is stupid. Shouldn't even have that issue on launch. Especially since you had pre-instal set up."
Dimitris Syrigos	5	November 11, 2020	One of the OGs let's goooooo.Game is spectacular,I love it.
Noob Gamer	1	November 11, 2020	Game stuck on loading screen.... trying to login but nothing is working so 1 star for now.
xion blake	2	November 11, 2020	There was issues I noticed. After the game downloaded and opened, the announcement looked glitched by mixing word into a checkerboad deign. When I login into a sever, the game kept closing on its own and I couldn't play the game.
Christina B	1	November 11, 2020	I was looking forward to trying the game but unfortunately i am unable to login or load past the main menu and notification box.
Anthony Cunningham	1	November 11, 2020	Game dosent even work. Hit tap to start and I just goes to a switching accounts tab and and repeats. What is up with these broken games lately. You better extend the deadline for claiming pre-registration gifts cause right players can't even log in
Matthew Lizama	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing
Joshuah Adair	1	November 11, 2020	Cant make it past the login screen, everytime I tap start it keeps saying my account is logging in then refreshes the screen hack to the login menue. Tried a multitude of times even reinstalled the app to no avail.
Eleets Steele	4	November 11, 2020	Nice graphics and character design, but there is a small glitch or problem. Whenever you try to access the Google play store to buy any in game items, it tries to disconnect you from the game.
alex22sins 7	5	November 11, 2020	The characters could use more on point with their names but is a really good game
Chevy Bass	5	November 11, 2020	Cool
Keith Holland	3	November 11, 2020	typical game thus far - not too far in - reminds me of E7 -
BigNugget Joe	3	November 11, 2020	"I'm giving this only a three coz right after the server maintenance I was able to play Then I closed it and reopened then I'm unable to ply it's stuck on the homescreen where it says ""press to continue"" I press then a long loading screen appears but it does nothing. Please fix that or I'll move onto some other game."
Kitt	5	November 11, 2020	I like it
Dreamer Kat	1	November 11, 2020	I would love to give the game a higher review but I can't even sign in to the game. It keeps saying it has to log me in and I am stuck in a loop to where it perpetually has to sign me in.
Mooji Plays	1	November 11, 2020	I was excited to download this game and once i saw the servers were up i opened the game and logged in. I pressed start and i never even got to play the game. It just stays at the homepage. When i press start it logs me in over and over. I havent got to play the game yet please fix this.
Nawaf 380	5	November 11, 2020	Awesomeness
Ivan Lozano	5	November 11, 2020	Gacha fun
Luxuking Kingdom	2	November 11, 2020	It's not letting me even get into the game
UcantrunB ucant	5	November 11, 2020	Love it
Moomin Bird	1	November 11, 2020	"No russian or ukrainian localization :C And the game simply can not be played. No way to load, no way to open it, it will not go through the ""logging into"" step. Heartbroken 💔"
Jacob Uribe	5	November 11, 2020	This is an awesome game, it has great graphics and gameplay
Trizza Tethis	1	November 11, 2020	Got into the game once and now when I try to play it tells me it's logging in then nothing happens after the login box disappears.
stevie kelly	3	November 11, 2020	So fsr so good just gotta see how the gwme progresses
david castana	5	November 11, 2020	Omega awesome
Pac mol	1	November 11, 2020	The global version is a cash grab for the summoning banners. I played the korean version and in there we can use the same tickets for every banner we want to summon for, I don't know why they decided to go full p2w in the global version. The only thing that I know for sure f2p players will stop playing this game because you need to spend a lot if you want to have the better units in game. And dont get me started on the advantage p2w players will have on pvp
James King	5	November 11, 2020	The characters need a auto fight doing missions so the player don't have to press attack moves anymore
David Ortiz	1	November 11, 2020	Already having problems going back to the game. It tells me to log in, i did with google log in. And it takes me back to the main page to start... Then i get stuck in a loop to start the game. What can i do. I been waiting two month to play and now i got it and cant play it. About to unistall it.
Jared Sutton	5	November 11, 2020	That's a good person to do this is the best of the world is going to work with you and your partner and you are not going anywhere until you have to be in our lives
Roberto Rutledge	5	November 11, 2020	Loving the synergy attacks along with the character models, so far so good.
nosoundnoman	5	November 11, 2020	I like it
Kevin	5	November 11, 2020	Very cool. 10/10 👍
Joey Moffett	3	November 11, 2020	Good so far. May update at later time.
LouisCristoff De Leon	5	November 11, 2020	ok
Alex Donalds	5	November 11, 2020	Great game and visuals
Ethan Walker	5	November 11, 2020	Edit: IT WORKS!! I got my account back with all of its data thank you so much
Forced Inertia	5	November 11, 2020	Fun
Corey Mcpherson	5	November 11, 2020	Everything is running fine and smooth very impressive so far
Jessica Hale	5	November 11, 2020	Update: I would like to thank to devs for working as fast as they did! I was just able to get back into the game and, although I had go redo the tutorial, my rewards are still there. For the fast action, I'll keep my rating at 5 stars. Thank you once again! :)
Alex Dramarco	1	November 11, 2020	They don't streamline the reroll process.. I don't feel like doing a lot of reinstalls today. Otherwise game seems very generic and time consuming...
Ignis Scientia	5	November 11, 2020	I like the story so far, it's entertaining. The characters are amazing, it feels like a lot of thought and effort went into them. Haven't made it too far in the game yet, but it feels like it's going to be fun. The turn based combat mechanic makes combat more enjoyable. Not too much to complain about if I'm being completely honest.
Mythical R3	5	November 11, 2020	Honestly, I can't give this more than 1 star at the moment. Game won't even log into a server. Uninstaller and reinstalled and still stays at the main screen. Will update review if able to get into game. Update: Got in game. Game is great to play, granted intro is a little dry, but it gets you started on the story.
Hoang Van	1	November 11, 2020	Behind the times look at illusion connect if you want to make a gatcha in today's world. You can't squeeze every penny out of your gatcha rates and not give out a lot of tickets for free. I would rather pay $100 when it feels good and I can pull a lot. 🤦‍♂️ Do some research before your marketing team goes ham.
Mint Bush	4	November 11, 2020	Wow did not expect it to be like that at all👀.......... Good game though
Naruki Hatsumi	4	November 11, 2020	The graphics are kinda bad but the game is good so far
Smart Primo	5	November 11, 2020	This is way to good, the quality is so smooth on the characters
Zen Mastiff	5	November 11, 2020	Very early on but enjoying it a lot.
Kaptain Riversnapps	2	November 11, 2020	Obnoxiously long tutorial, piss poor animations, passable graphics, decent battle system. This thing was just quickly built to make money. Oh, and it's a Fate clone for some stupid reason. Couldn't come up with original characters I guess.
Carl Johnson	4	November 11, 2020	So far so good.
Brandon Krauch	5	November 11, 2020	Fun!!
Deku Midoria	5	November 11, 2020	its a great game so far keep up the good work
Reece Town XD	1	November 11, 2020	Turn based attacks ewww . Great graphics though I thought it'd be open world experience & battle like genshin impact.
SaberOfTheRed	5	November 11, 2020	Fun~
Fallonmoon	1	November 11, 2020	Not a f2p friendly game
Osyriss	5	November 11, 2020	So far it is very interesting and fun. The game is not pay to win, and the characters are very beautiful. Overall, it is a very great game.
Aryan Gupta	5	November 11, 2020	Waiting.....
ZombiePro gaming	5	November 11, 2020	Got the game to work and no more problems yet as for the people complaining about the pre-download you fools need to get some more brain cells because that is to let you download before the game is released that way you can play instantly when the game does release hence (Pre-) download lol. Game looks and feels amazing btw was definitely worth the wait thanks team.
Potato 3867	1	November 11, 2020	Trash p2w
Jesus Gaspar	5	November 11, 2020	This game is pretty good with the graphics. Also has easy control and fun so far.

Subtitle Killer	5	November 11, 2020	Can't login. Nice.
Sarun Thomason	4	November 11, 2020	This game is great for giveing me at least one ssr in my frist ten pull.
Sora Keyblade	5	November 11, 2020	THE BEST GAME EVER it's just like summoners war but 10 times better!!!!!!!!!
Remy Van Soest	5	November 11, 2020	Great Game with very Good Graphics and u can get new characters with Gasha style system. Pretty F2P so far as well.
Xd Night12	5	November 11, 2020	This game is asome
lBLu SilVz	5	November 11, 2020	So far about an hour in an im hooked. Characters look great, combats fun, an its literally war of the waifus lmao ENJOY!
Bryce McCurine	5	November 11, 2020	It is a great game and you get so much. Wish more games would be like this.
Emerson Enio	5	November 11, 2020	Muito bom.
Fall of Babel	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing animations! Every character seems to have a lot of personality to them. It's very nice to see so much effort put into a mobile game.
John Dela Rosa	5	November 11, 2020	Ok
Ludicrous ___	5	November 11, 2020	Pretty good so far
Jason Escobar	5	November 11, 2020	Nice
Stick Figure Zombies	1	November 11, 2020	Now I can say that this game was worth the wait and I see a lot of potential, keep it up. Dont lose interest please
Dorjon Ben Livingston	5	November 11, 2020	Well the game just started so far so good. Ill change my info after more game play
Ramon Rydell	1	November 11, 2020	Hard pass. I'm $4800 into the Chinese version but we cant convert our accounts to this one?even though EVERYTHING is EXACTLY the same...? Yeah, Goodluck with that.
Samantha Lynchard	3	November 11, 2020	Going fine so far.
Hayden Pullen	5	November 11, 2020	Good
Isaiah Garrett	5	November 11, 2020	So far so good
Jeff Cooper	1	November 11, 2020	They decided to bring the rate up banners using a different ticket to global, and yes I know you can get them from events, it's still not a good way to make your players happy.
Aaron Soto	5	November 11, 2020	This is an amazing game the visuals are beautiful and the story is great.
Fairy Jarry	5	November 11, 2020	Love it
Álisson Sales	4	November 11, 2020	So far so good, but having a 'premium' currency for chance up banner is not a very smart move...
Uvaldo Luna	5	November 11, 2020	Great game so far
Cb Parkin	4	November 11, 2020	Just started today and so far am pleased with how smooth the gameplay is.
NAW Daimondz	5	November 11, 2020	The game is amazing. Everything about this game is amazing. I suggest you play this game if you haven't tried it yet. 😁
Kira	4	November 11, 2020	So far so good. Graphics are of good quality; no lagging or plain out bad backgrounds etc. Controls are easy to use and you get the hang of it pretty quick. Seems to me there's quite the catch of fanservice, which can be a pro or con depending on the player. I was hoping to customize the protagonist to my liking, but that's just a minor and personal issue. Overall, it seems like a good game :)
L san	1	November 11, 2020	It's keeps shutting off everytime I try to enter the game 🙄 I don't know if it's because it came out not too long ago but um, I can't play soo I'm giving it 1 star. I'll switch this review if it begins to work. Edit: I did reinstall the game. It did nothing.
Сергей Изместьев	1	November 11, 2020	200mbit/s WiFi - failed connect to server....
Shawn Maple	5	November 11, 2020	Really fun game, I'm loving it so far.
EarlySnow	5	November 11, 2020	Beautiful art style with fantastic voice acting.
Stephan Zievinger	5	November 11, 2020	Heck great game. A bit legy though 👍
GOD TITAN	5	November 11, 2020	Its a really good game so far and im not saying that be nice i really like it
T S	4	November 11, 2020	Pretty graphics and fun turn based battle system. The story has not drawn me in by chapter 1. The gatcha is pretty standard gatcha with beautiful character design.
L 5h4dowW0lf L	5	November 11, 2020	So far excellent keep it up don't disappoint me
Stephanie Huskey	5	November 11, 2020	So far it is good. Only lvl 6 but the art is beautiful and story line is good too
david johnson	4	November 11, 2020	Pretty good
Deth StarZ	5	November 11, 2020	Many thanks for fixing the log in problem . The game is amazing
Mabrouk ghost07	1	November 11, 2020	pure p2w system where you acually summon good units with only money , this game had a bright future but gacha system yeah no thank you
sharat kumar	1	November 11, 2020	I only played for few minutes and I can already see how bad it is. First the text in text box is very small which makes it very hard to read. You start with a scene cut with ridiculous pacing and it feels like I am watching a yt video at 10x. Battle mechanics aren't something new, just your regular turn based slash and hash with skill animations being very long. It feels like no thought has been put on the story and feels like they just put it to fill in the holes.
molnar tivadar	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome game keep up the good work.
Nestor Gonzalez	5	November 11, 2020	Fun
Jaden Sorrows	5	November 11, 2020	Good graphics and easy to play
AnubratAnurag Chatterjee	5	November 11, 2020	I started playing this game for like thirty minutes and OMG, I'm blown away. This game takes RPG to another level. Easy to understand controls, really fun. They also gave me a 10x summon which granted me an SSR hero early on. This game was worth the wait. Love everyone who made this game, success ensured!!
Kendrick Ladd	5	November 11, 2020	Just started and Ive already put everything off for today love it...
Joseph Jauregui	5	November 11, 2020	Fresh breath Gacha, graphics nice. Like the take turn and skill animations. Looking forward to new Heros!

Hekema	1	November 11, 2020	Savedata wiped. I have no idea how, but after logging in with Google, I played for an hour, closed the game and when I rebooted I had to start over?
Yvette Larsen	3	November 11, 2020	It's caught my attetion
Frédéric Côté	4	November 11, 2020	I could login with google once and play. Now I try to enter the game again and it doesnt work. It keeps trying to login to google over and over. Edit: I already tried switching and it does the same thing. I also saw another review with the same problem. Edit2: seems it's fixed now
Wes Walker	5	November 11, 2020	Really fun game
Stephen Abarilles	5	November 11, 2020	So far so good. Will update after a week of gameplay.
Miah Lopez	5	November 11, 2020	Great game so far, my only hope is that they give an option to skip the tutorial and have it be an almost book like thing where u can go IF you dont know something and possibly make it skippable for people who play these a lot
Trojan King	5	November 11, 2020	Just started the game so far, runs smooth, great graphic, game has potential 🤘
VivyDeBunny	4	November 11, 2020	I'll rate more accurate later
the gaming Fox	3	November 11, 2020	Its seems fun so far but the BIG PROBLEM is that i have to pay to summon on any banner but the main perminate banner there are 4 other banners i cant even buy tickets in shop for.
Alan Diep	5	November 11, 2020	Love the graphical worth the wait
Miguel Angel Jr	5	November 11, 2020	👍👍👍👍👍

Mark Powers	5	November 11, 2020	5 stars to make up for the ungrateful fools guving 1 star because of pre-load. Great game though. Nothing really new, but it runs smooth on my old phone and game flow is smooth and progressive.
Stormiesunny	4	November 11, 2020	This is a pretty damn good game. I'm so excited this is finally in fully english.
Randain Wright	5	November 11, 2020	Premium turn base RPG. So far it's fun, lets see what the end game has to offer.

MuteSpittah	5	November 11, 2020	Wonderful game!
mlontajo	5	November 11, 2020	Nice good
Sky Knight	5	November 11, 2020	I'm still early in the game but it looks great, and the depth of gameplay definitely looks Ike it will keep an avid RPGer playing for countless hours.
Gabriel LaVedier	5	November 11, 2020	Works very well even on an older phone. Excellent graphics, good banter dialogue with fun takes on classic characters. Marco Polo is just too cute. Fun and enjoyable RPG.
Jordan Coggins	4	November 11, 2020	Huge langrisser fan so I'm biased. Characters are cool and I'm not far enough into the story before they ask for a review. Another hero collector but it's worth the download
sam colman	5	November 11, 2020	Nice so far
2brute 4you	5	November 11, 2020	Im enjoying the game so far. Keep up the good work

toy of depression	5	November 11, 2020	"I can't even start the game, the game ignoring my tapping on ""tap to start"". I can't even log in to claim my 10x thing for playing before it's obt or whatever, sad thing UPD: ok so it's all good now, my problem was fixed very quickly and I finally could enjoy the game, the graphics is pretty good the same as the level of the effects and stuff, I enjoyed the process especially in opening and unlocking new gear and characters 12/10"
Caleb Quinn	3	November 11, 2020	Got the issue fixed so starting to play now impressed by the quick customer service will update after some play time
Michael Lougheed	5	November 11, 2020	This game is so much fun! The graphics are very cute and well done and the whole asthetic and story of the game is well done!
Xie He	4	November 11, 2020	Very nice graphics and story. Not 5* because it's another pay to win game obviously.
Noah Wilson	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game
Inor Crys	5	November 11, 2020	Beautiful graphics
GUSTAVO Bazo	5	November 11, 2020	Very fun
Abyssal Kaz	5	November 11, 2020	Love the game, especially when my phone is old as heck it barely skips any frames
nate Ward	3	November 11, 2020	The audio is some times choppy and I've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, otherwise it seems fun
Megan Warner	5	November 11, 2020	This game is awesome
Kairo TheSunGod	5	November 11, 2020	I love the animation and progression system, the story line is amazing and I can't wait to see further updates.
Joshua Stephens	5	November 11, 2020	First summon on my own and I got bae I've wanted since the game was announced. I'm set in. This game is what Lord of Heroes wanted to be
Andrew Linton	5	November 11, 2020	I LOVE this game thus far!!!
David Suriel	5	November 11, 2020	Love the artwork and character design, combat system is also great with the assist and support system. Overall 2 thumbs up
Brad Adkins	5	November 11, 2020	Good story. Easy system.
John Colon	2	November 11, 2020	The game is ok if you could mary the hero you want.😕
Waymie Malone	5	November 11, 2020	Great game and graphics loving the game so far. Cant wait to see what else it offers
Branden Rivera	4	November 11, 2020	Its pretty decent as I play more ill come update this but smooth so far
Cj MadLife	4	November 11, 2020	Good game
Elijah Muhich	5	November 11, 2020	Great game so far
Malice Wolf	5	November 11, 2020	So far I really like the character designs the combat is simple turn-based and the graphics are pretty good I like it. :)
Draven Keach	5	November 11, 2020	It is like playing final fandesy
Net Tech	1	November 11, 2020	Can't create your own character, so you are stuck with the appearance and class of what they designed. Story seems similar to so many others but with minor changes. Takes forever to gain control from the intro tutorial.
The Noodle	2	November 11, 2020	I bought a pack that was supposed to give me 3 Genesis Tarrot cards, and Ive also collected rewards that were supposed to give me the same, but it still says I have 0 Gensis Tarrot cards. The game itself is good, but whats the point pf playing it if I cant get my rewards?
Planetmorgoth	5	November 11, 2020	Has child nudity!!! EDIT: on second thought maybe its ok!???
Israel Rojas	5	November 11, 2020	So far so good just started got plenty of benefits from what I can understand. Also game play is smooth, the story is captivating n humorous, n the anime like graphics,art is gorgeous. The cache system is well designed for you'll be capable of raising a low tier to a high tier character. So if you're looking for something new give this one a chance.
Joshua Multon	5	November 11, 2020	Just started kinda dope
Kristopher Pelgrave	4	November 11, 2020	Barely started playing but seems good so far
Dakota Marshall-Brown	5	November 11, 2020	I love the game, but I did want to point out that in act 1, Cupid glitches a lot when she is speaking. In the scene she has nothing in her hands when moving, but you would see appearances of her silver tray that she holds pop up randomly in the shots when it shouldn't be there.
Oscar Ramos	3	November 11, 2020	Decent game love the characters. Graphics r good hope there's more customizing in later updates
Edwin Ayala	5	November 11, 2020	Im loveing it
spoodermun	5	November 11, 2020	Its good
BlueSkyAngeluz	5	November 11, 2020	Fantastic game, still has its issues like the choppy sounds in cutscenes but these will get fixed over time. So far, loving it.
Bradley West	5	November 11, 2020	Great
Manuel Varela	5	November 11, 2020	I love where the story is going.
ImposterFlame	5	November 11, 2020	This fun j really like it and it is smooth
B Bochenek	3	November 11, 2020	We will see
James Milan	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome gatcha! Some of my favs are here. This may drop if the system is unbalanced but i haven't seen such yet. Going to put work into some of the lower starred characters to make them top tier. That will tell me if it is balanced or not. Much love though so far
Mike Larwy	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome game to play
Wiz Gi	4	November 11, 2020	Its fun
Vinicius Mello	1	November 11, 2020	"The classic ""if I make nice looking game can I get way with everything?"". The awful you can only-click-one-place tutorial, lag and the skip that gives you hope but only skip a little bit. How do you expect me to like the game if my experience is: skip, click here no other option allowed, fight easy scenario with tons of mob no aoe or auto. Repeat this 100x."
David Chavez	5	November 11, 2020	So far I love it
PussySlayer 9000	5	November 11, 2020	Its lit
SilverFire King	5	November 11, 2020	This game is AWESOME!!!!
Undead Moss	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing
Bonnie Moyer	4	November 11, 2020	So far so good
William Parker	5	November 11, 2020	Great so far
Nelson Roman	5	November 11, 2020	I luv the game but for some reason the animation for attacks or special attacks dnt show n needs to be fixed. I really like the game I would love it more if the animation for using skills was fixed
Thomas Gabby	4	November 11, 2020	"Very colorful, story lines are kind of cheesy and overall, kind of an Okay game. I am only in the game about 1 hour in, so i cant say for certain how the game pans out,but it does scratch that ""I am bored"" itch."
Gregory Linsinbigler	5	November 11, 2020	A beautiful game
Peach Swaggn	5	November 11, 2020	Yes I Loved It ❤️💪👍💯😛😜😁😊😯👊😍🤩
Asuna Yuuki	5	November 11, 2020	An amazing game
Quang Lam	1	November 11, 2020	while i like the gameplay and the characters, the way the servers are implemented reminds me of other games where they have initial servers, then release new servers, and then more servers, and even more servers. the initial servers then die off and all the work you put in to those servers is wasted. ill keep playing this for a bit but im definitely going to quit once those other servers are released
Nasir Brewer	4	November 11, 2020	Great game nice story and isnt super tedious with upgrades and things as for what I've seen theres only one issue whenever cupid's onscreen during the story a plate or whatever it is she holds flashes across the screen at random
T S	5	November 11, 2020	Why not
Michael French Sr	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome!
xtimertx cronos	4	November 11, 2020	Those who have gave bad ratings just gave up and didn't try so they need to stfu
Jesus Morales	2	November 11, 2020	Is very buggy i installed it and already buggy come on and well graphics are a bit dissapointing i will keep my eye on this game for any updates it may have
Thomas Rice	3	November 11, 2020	Don't know yet. It asked me way to early if I like it. Move the rating suggestion at least after chapter 1. I played the Intro and it's asking me if I like it. I don't know yet
J.P 1981	4	November 11, 2020	Started an hour ago and I already like the gameplay. Hopefully the story turns out good as well.
Kevin Child	1	November 11, 2020	Literally unplayable on my Galaxy S10+. Go to log in, and a pop up text bar with no text shows up briefly, then goes away. Tried to log in under all the options, even Guest, but to no avail. Will reinstall and see if that fixes it, but if not, will keep at one star...since I have a recent phone that should be able to play it, but can't. Edit: re-installed, tried everything like before, still the same result. Shame, game looked fun.
Jerry Martinez	5	November 11, 2020	Great graphics
Ultra Dodongo	5	November 11, 2020	Haven't played much yet but has been enjoyable so far. I dislike the cheap packs to get you to spend money right off the bat.
Mohammed Jassim	5	November 11, 2020	Cool game
Broken Machine	5	November 11, 2020	Honest at first I wasn't expecting this game to be as good as it is already I really enjoy it
Autumn Haskell	5	November 11, 2020	Super fun so far! Will update later w/more detail 💞
Casper Fang	3	November 11, 2020	Meh. Underwhelming
Alan Stewart	4	November 11, 2020	I'm liking it so far, the graphics are really nice, the skills look great and I've experienced ZERO lag!
Peter Chen	1	November 11, 2020	P2W trash china game
Thomas Rulon	5	November 11, 2020	The storyline is pretty decent thus far. Graphics are awesome. This isn't your average tachs game but is a tachs game nonetheless. I encourage those that are interested to give this game a try.
TFS Cosmic	3	November 11, 2020	It's a good game but after I tried to play it later the app won't open it stays at a white screen any help?
Midnight Howler	5	November 11, 2020	Fun Fun Fun!!!
Thunder Muffn	3	November 11, 2020	Game is alright. Only thing I dont really like is so far it seems the only way to get Genesis tickets is to buy them. And they are what you use to get better units and specific units in the gacha essentially making the game pay-to-win. I'd rate alot better if there were a way to get these without being forced to spend money. Reply to developer: As the game is now there are no ways to get Genesis tickets. Events may come in the future but my rating isn't for the future its for the game now.
Gray angel 444 mix	5	November 11, 2020	the story is actually engaging and very appealing chapters hoping to see more
Corey Holmed	5	November 11, 2020	Very nice graphics and storyline
Trye Fam	5	November 11, 2020	Good game overall
Andres Herrera	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome!!!
Joseph Morelli	4	November 11, 2020	Took a while to go global. Its finally here. Really fun so far. Graphics are great and smooth on my tablet. Good story so far. I don't know which units are the best so I don't know how drop rates are yet. If you like collectors... Give this a shot.
Tim Baker	5	November 11, 2020	Good so far
Alexis Sara	1	November 11, 2020	No Girl protagonist. Sure established characters of myth and history can have their genders changed but the player wanting to be a woman is too wild.
Michael Becker	5	November 11, 2020	Got into the game once but now it won't let me log in anymore. It just gets stuck on the main screen. Each time I tap to enter it tries to login but then doesn't and stays on the main screen. Hard to enjoy a game you can't play. Edit: Issue was quickly resolved and I'm able to play and enjoy the game.
Nicholas Morales	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome
Michael P	4	November 11, 2020	It's fun and looks nice
Nathan Peraza	5	November 11, 2020	Great game i just started but my phone can take the frame so it really good
Victoria Rodriguez	5	November 11, 2020	Love it so far
kid cam101	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing love this game🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍
David Duvall	4	November 11, 2020	Great game so far
Jairo Renteria	5	November 11, 2020	awesome game
Timothy Branning	5	November 11, 2020	It's pretty cool atm
Justin Vandewater	1	November 11, 2020	Heros and game play are bland. The wanted me to edit my post sense they responded to my review. I would rate even lower sense they have a paywall for banner summons. They say we will continue optimizing..... this is a global launch we will just get a slow trickel from the parent game. In all this just a sad pathetic money grab from a greedy publisher. Wouldnt waste money if you don't like being number 1 in an empty server.
Kevin Ryan	5	November 11, 2020	very fun
zack hat	5	November 11, 2020	Well...devs quick to respond..servers workin game runs smooth.. Graphics r sweeet..story is nice lets hope it continues.. Pre registration rewards and still after the game didnt work very nice to see it come together..
Sheep Fins	5	November 11, 2020	I like throwing panda bombs. 10/10 The graphics are good. It also seems that you can upgrade any character to max rarity which i like. The special draw only boost the chances of getting a specific character. The normal draw currently has all the characters in it so you dont have to pay anything for it. Also mustache slime, best character.
Jesse Osieczonek	5	November 11, 2020	Great game so far let's see how it goes.
Du za	5	November 11, 2020	amazing game, graphics are nice and the character design is pretty good
Cyclonic Supercell	5	November 11, 2020	Just got into it but awesome so far.
serena180	3	November 11, 2020	I dont like how every popular user name in existance is taken and the game looks great im sure it will b fun but a guy protagonist really dum this game is all girls it should b a female knight protagonist to and the game needs le3sbian love dateing our its another sexcist game give woman the spotlight not guy
ARRDWOLF :-P	5	November 11, 2020	👍
Dark Unknown	5	November 11, 2020	I Really like the game
Russell Schroeder	5	November 11, 2020	Fun 2 play
Dark Soul	2	November 11, 2020	I really don't support gacha games that won't let you reroll or give you a selector ticket at the start. Says a lot about the company.
SypherSeven	1	November 11, 2020	Not willing to invest the time or money. I'm done with RNG. Want my money? Let me purchase what I want when I want it.
Bouya	2	November 11, 2020	Really nice graphics and animations. All of the characters look nice and the gameplay is fine. The big issue is the gacha, there needs to be more ways to earn genesis tickets other than paying or saving for months. It comes off as super scummy and pretty much locks f2p and low spending players out of rate-up banners. Also, there needs to be more info about the summon rates in the game, I've been told there is a pity but there is no proof of one in the game itself.
Corb Allen	5	November 11, 2020	Yay!! The game works very well very good story and game
Gally GGG	2	November 11, 2020	Cheeesy story and kid like music drove me nuts.. Unistalled
Gaming Legend	5	November 11, 2020	So far the game is a good strategy classic game with good story and graphics. Good simple game play mechanics really addictive once you start. I just wished the game revolved more on skill and luck than pay to win. Overall great game except purchases because some people get a leap that others can't because we don't spend money. While we just play to enjoy everything the game has to offer.
Christian Heyes	5	November 11, 2020	Great game so far..
Infinite XP	3	November 11, 2020	Edited: Like I stated before it's a good game, however now that I played for a few hours I've seen a stupid paywall which has two different types of tickets, the Premium ones that you have to purchase or save up your gems in order to get the UP rate banners, or just save up to get the basic gold tickets & pray to rng you'll acquire a SSR. The gameplay is fun, the rates are ok (alot better than Genshins) also the devs should give more for your buck you spend. Overall, I don't like it but whatever
Edward Norris	5	November 11, 2020	Good game
Jamie Strosnider	5	November 11, 2020	Absolutely beautiful game love it it is stunning!
Sanchez Roulhac	5	November 11, 2020	This is cool
Great Zong	3	November 11, 2020	Why must I provide email access in order to play the game? Can't play without it. Big sus.
John Rivera	1	November 11, 2020	"This game is pay to win, 1 star, still gonna play it just wanted to give it a 1 star to be a douche bag. ( the ""free"" 10 pull is set up to give you garbage!"
David Escobedo	5	November 11, 2020	Good game
Houston Stacy	5	November 11, 2020	Great game 👍
JaxDood43	1	November 11, 2020	It's not letting me download, it will sit there and say pending and hasnr downloaded for 17 minutes now Edit: it worked and I will changes stars or leave them the way they are if it isn't great
Steve Illsley	1	November 11, 2020	Just the newest waifu gatcha auto game. Pass.
StonyGoose 5513	5	November 11, 2020	I like the characters and the little cut scene before attack
jerney mendiola	1	November 11, 2020	Meh ok. Wish there wasnt a paid banner where only people who pay can go on. Nothing has changed from the version before global. The reason they lost so many players. Idk how long im gonna play this. Needs to be fixed Asap.
Giovanni Strolla	4	November 11, 2020	So far so good...
mudding maythem97	5	November 11, 2020	So far a great game I'm enjoying it
Alyssa Diaz	5	November 11, 2020	Great game so far, hope they continue with it.
Jesse Hopper	5	November 11, 2020	I really like the game, but the font is so small, it is hard to read and I may not continue playing due to that.
Kendrick Johnson Jr	5	November 11, 2020	Absolutely love the character design and combat system. Voice overs are great, story very entertaining so far. Disappointed that all the feature character summon banners are paid currency only, so far my only issue but everything else is good so far. I look forward to watch this game develop.
Khrix Azreal	1	November 11, 2020	WORST GACHA!! HahaXd.. the rating is Fake..!! Wow the specific hero banner are only For P2P players...thats Outrageous..# Zlong games you cant even offer what Basic gacha does. Thats a sh##te.. A game where you will never obtain your desire hero!! Another Crashgrab game in playstore.. Thanks for the hype.. anyway.. Dont even deserve 2 FOO*****king ⭐⭐!! .
CloveRBitz	1	November 11, 2020	LOL locking good units behind paywall,, i dont know why you are very hostile to the F2P, you only think the revenue not the players. Disappointed..
Mehak Bajwa	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome game😊😊
Dominique Edwards	5	November 11, 2020	I've just started the game. So I'm going to hold off on giving an in-depth review.
Eric 13 Martin 14	5	November 11, 2020	So far i like it its really fun has great graphics and easy to play itd be even better if there was a english dub in the game so we can listen to it while reading it
lul papaya	5	November 11, 2020	i like it a lot. i dont mind the summonings, they're quite a fair rate when it comes to the summoning of the gacha tiers. the storyline is interesting and all the characters dynamic and have really cool and interesting designs. i havent seen a reason to purchase anything from this game other than to get some limited character which i dont mind at all, plus they're sold at a really fair price which surprised me a lot. it's not perfect but i like it a lot.
Jeremy Zych	5	November 11, 2020	Fun way to pass the time so far
sai playz	5	November 11, 2020	Good game I'm the best player in the world right now I'm a God and its a good game
Mr. Mattrocity	5	November 11, 2020	Fixed bug, much better!
James Rose Jr	5	November 11, 2020	"Having problems connecting to servers.😔 Will change rating once I am able to play it.""Edit"" Finally able to play it and I must say I'm enjoying the storyline, graphics and the characters!! 😎"
Lightning 405	5	November 11, 2020	Can't play till tomorrow but looks good
Rayhart	3	November 11, 2020	Very cool game and with great gameplay but all the QoL have to be paid to unlock unlike most other game. There is so much potential for this game but the company haven't learn a thing from Langrisser
Quietlife	5	November 11, 2020	i have no complaints
DizzyD3zi Boo	5	November 11, 2020	Sweet
Spooby Stark	4	November 11, 2020	Graphics and animations are pretty clean and crisp. Characters are cool, although I only have a few starter characters. I'll review this more as I play it more.
Slinkier The Disconnected	2	November 11, 2020	Seem good but the start is already bad in my opinion. The graphics is really good, gameplay idk just saw the tutorial (a bit annoying). The problem is about gacha. Out of 7 only 3 are free, other you need to buy the tickets for try them. I can understand 1/2 premium only for who pay, but instead the majority are only for who pay. Smell too much as money grab game.
Im Chillzzz	5	November 11, 2020	This game is super fun and the graphics are pretty great for a moble game that only takes 1gb
John Barry	5	November 11, 2020	So far I love the game. Still getting use to it. The graphics are great animation on the skills are cool. So far so good I think its a good game.
Rick	5	November 11, 2020	I like it, try it for yourself.
Hamza Ait talbe	4	November 11, 2020	The game servers are not running
reimi jahana	4	November 11, 2020	I agree with what a lot of people are saying. So far game seems p2w as it relates to summons but if you build your units they can be good. Story is also pretty good
Wyatt Cavanaugh	5	November 11, 2020	Has been good so far
Nezha	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game
Coolio	5	November 11, 2020	Fun
louis rood jhon junior	5	November 11, 2020	So far it's been a pretty good game
Michael Ramirez	4	November 11, 2020	Interesting game, I ws gonna uninstall if I didn't like it but i gave it a chance and it's not bad at all.
shao	1	November 11, 2020	the game doesnt work on emulator
Pedro Fregoso	5	November 11, 2020	It's pretty nice. Great graphics too. I'd recommend it.
Terra Chere	5	November 11, 2020	Fun
manuel andrade	5	November 11, 2020	good game i loveD
Alex Chu	5	November 11, 2020	Double ssr first 10 summon Awesome
Eric McCoin	5	November 11, 2020	Really damn good game love it
Joules Lyonheart	5	November 11, 2020	Great game so far. Very nice looking with amazing Fx and character animations looking forward to playing more
Cody Perratore	1	November 11, 2020	"a pay to win with 2% SSR rate that is another heavily cliche game, where known characters in literature or history are supposed to be ""unique"" characters somehow coming together. Majority of bonuses are reliant on paid packages (4/9 events), little given despite pre-registration. Combat system is also basic turn-based relying on elements giving advantage/disadvantage so nothing original here either, though graphics are beautiful. Very unoriginal and basic, with a lot of p2w, what a waste"
Experiment.	1	November 11, 2020	This would easily be a 4/5 star game if it weren't for the timed events. Here in Europe, the Joint Task force starts at 3am everyday, which gives good and much needed rewards. Sorry but I'm not waking up at 3am everyday to do an event. Either open servers that are suitable for Europeans time zone, or stay at 1 star.
Allan Trojan	2	November 11, 2020	Writing my review again, since it disappeared somehow... Same as other people pointed out, the gatcha system is my problem also, having some summons behind a paywall is bad, and copying pasting the same message here to calm players down is even worse... I usually spend money on games who I believe are fare and fun, but this is not the case. Very disappointed.
jeramy clay	1	November 11, 2020	You guys going to get these glitches fixed cuz this is what's going to happen to games when they don't work on tablets
Neko Senpai	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing graphics
Scott Doyle	5	November 11, 2020	Seems like a good start to a new game. Characters are designed wel, English translations are correct, combo system employs multiple hero animations, and the story is interesting thus far.
Mechanomics	1	November 11, 2020	As others have said, top tier units are locked behind a paywall. There is a split up of free and paid currency. This's a terrible model and events where you have to put in a lot of time for little paid currency doesn't change that.
Christian Murphy	5	November 11, 2020	"Funny way to ask for a review... ""Help us stem the darktide."""
Johnnie Guy	5	November 11, 2020	I love the art!
evildom scarbro2	5	November 11, 2020	I like it
Johnny	4	November 11, 2020	Its good so far.
Chris Cag	3	November 11, 2020	I'll see how it goes but so far so good
Dusk	1	November 11, 2020	Worst game of 2020 doesn't even feel friendly
Huu Nguyen	5	November 11, 2020	Love the hero design. Graphic is superbly made. A+
Daniel Stafford	4	November 11, 2020	Give it a shot if you like these kinds of games
Quil Valentine	5	November 11, 2020	"So far the game looks pretty good. There is a split currency for banners but all of the units on the rate up banners are available to summon in the ""free"" regular banner as well. As long as f2p have a chance to get them I don't see an issue. Graphics are nice, and the characters are generally pretty cool looking. Also combat is turn based, which I love."

Scott Veenstra	5	November 11, 2020	Great game, lots of fun
ChickenNuggie	1	November 11, 2020	Pretty much made for a quick cash grab from what I can see up to now.
adrian bajbakow	1	November 11, 2020	Another paid Asian garbage. Game was just released yrt there's no free banner. All are paid 1/100
Jerry Hansen	5	November 11, 2020	Great Game highly recomend.
William Medina	1	November 11, 2020	Are there only three characters in game? I mean I re rolled in 5 different accounts and in the two servers for each a total of 10 accounts and they only gave gabriel, Michael and valkyrie no changes no other SSRI character,you're kidding me right! Not gonna play this version
Alex Lightner	5	November 11, 2020	Love it
_x•Toast•x_	5	November 11, 2020	This is now one of my favorite RPG games It has amazing graphics amazing gameplay and it is really fun and exciting ❤️
Eagle Attacks	1	November 11, 2020	I had high hopes for this game. I saw it was from the devs who made Langrisser, and hoped they learned from the awful launch that, that game had but they launch at low drop rates, time-gated modes, paywalled rate-up banners and QoL behind a monthly subscription that feels like the QoL should have been in the game by default. Why is this team just plagued with terrible launches, guys I WANNA play your games but you're going out of your way to just cripple your game and I will be uninstallling.
Cody York	5	November 11, 2020	So far so good graphics are good gameplay aint bad tutorial isn't too long
Paranoid Panada	5	November 11, 2020	For the impatient people who don't know what starts Nov 10 means and what a pre- download is for
Xin Ordinary	3	November 11, 2020	The game is exceptional but does needs to improve the gameplay , it seems the skill animation has very little effort worked on it and the banners have a paywall which is weird but anything the game is okay
Chrono Arcadia	5	November 11, 2020	Its actually fun!
Fred	5	November 11, 2020	Minor bugs at launch but they quickly fixed it! Great graphics short load times and good story.
Jonathan Shelley	5	November 11, 2020	Good game
Leo Li	1	November 11, 2020	Paywall game. Not gonna progress unless u cough up some money. Monthly card does not give premium summon. So ftp is just gonna be fodder.
Nathan Payne	3	November 11, 2020	Just started, so far it's good
Ugly Casanova	3	November 11, 2020	So after a couple hours it is yet another gacha with nothing new. No pity pulls for SSR a 2% on TOP of paid vs free currency is a good way to lose players fast. No language specific chat so enjoy the thousands of messages in spanish and portuguese!! Characters are cool to see the takes on all people of mythos and fairy tales. Just not seeing enough here too make it stand out, plus no pity pulls AND premium currency... will not end well once the whales get bored. RiP a good game killed by greed.
Shane Ayule	5	November 11, 2020	Fun, exciting, different. Very enjoyable and so far loving it
Eric Jacobson	4	November 11, 2020	Fun
JESTONI PASCUAL	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing graphics decent game play
Terrence Elbert	5	November 11, 2020	Fun
Ray Matthews	1	November 11, 2020	Updated Review: The game plays it self. Any game you can auto play all the way through, is garbage. I need control, diversity; give options. I deleted the game from my phone. But you may like it. 💯
J Rod	5	November 11, 2020	We will see
Lance Knight	4	November 11, 2020	So far so good it is leaning towards pay 2 win tho an the pre registration awards was very bad as it did not get you ready anything in the game at all the battles are turn based which is great an also the story so far is engaging they really should have giving up better rewards so per registration it runs smoothly no glitches an freezing so far I hope they fix the poor rewards they gave us but over all it's a game worth playing an seeing how u like it.
Dragon Gomez	4	November 11, 2020	Good graphics and an intriguing story. There is good humor in the dialogue, and the way characters are designed is something I personally enjoy.
Dakota Gettier	4	November 11, 2020	Good so far
Jeremiah Hernandez	5	November 11, 2020	Very great game
smashy kid	5	November 11, 2020	Good game
人風	4	November 11, 2020	Seems similar to other games so far. Also looks kinda p2win
Ricky Hall	5	November 11, 2020	Great job... ❤️💜💔💘♥️💗💖💖💞💓💕🌟⭐✨🧚🧜🧞🚵🕺🦹💯💯💯💃💃💃🦸🦸💟💜💜💜
Coty Morris	4	November 11, 2020	Love the game wish it had more fan service but I do think the genesis tarot cards should be easier to come by specially on the over sea version way to hard makes it so hard to summon in these timed events
Lokesh Korabu	5	November 11, 2020	Great game, don't consider negative reviews, u will get all heroes eventually and also growing them needs time, so this is not a fast finishing game Anyway wish more and more players come
thebest gochalife	5	November 11, 2020	So far one of the best games ever And if you don't play it your just trash at everything but if you do play my in game name is たあか
Elizabeth Starr	1	November 11, 2020	Not wat I expected
vincent	5	November 11, 2020	Fun game
Cado	5	November 11, 2020	After playing the game, it's really fun and is not bad for f2p players l, the game gives you enough for characters summons and they aren't blocked behind a paywall at all
Velvet Barta	5	November 11, 2020	Top rateing game only thing is that they need to speak English.
Spirit Comics	1	November 11, 2020	I was hoping this would have an interesting story and gameplay like some others. Instead it seems to be just turn based. The text flies by so fast that I can't read it. I won't be keeping this one.
Valerak Reave	5	November 11, 2020	I don't see what people say about the rates first character pull got an SSR lol
Cyril Brabant	5	November 11, 2020	Tutorial is too long, artwork and graphics are great. The gameplay variety is nice but come on, its 2020,make the tutorial skipable
advanced peel7	5	November 11, 2020	So far from went all I've done in the game and seen in the game beautiful Graphics beautiful game play controls are easy to do overall great work I'll really love in this game highly recommend playing it
Lucas Kowalsky	1	November 11, 2020	So F2P unfriendly it's DoA sadly
Beau Britton	5	November 11, 2020	paywqll for limited units it seems. maybe in a year when hero's are move available this will be fun.
Chris Riley	5	November 11, 2020	So far so good. Love the characters
Unruly Dubstep	1	November 11, 2020	"Game is good in general, I just hate you have to tap skip 24/7 in order to progress threw the content and mission end screen has 2 ending screens ""sigh"" just give me the loot and skip the darn box opening so I can keep going ""face palm"" Update in second thought why have energy when there's no gear drops or other loot drops from missions this game definitely gets a 1 star"
Bernardo Sivieri	1	November 11, 2020	I've played this game TWO YEARS AGO. I played this on the KR version and the differences are so so sad. Premium currency for the banners? Only 15 summons from the pre reg? God this is so sad... I won't be playing this game.
Sujith Kumar	5	November 11, 2020	Good game..lov it
Benjamin Campbell	5	November 11, 2020	Although new its eay better than most others on the market
Ian Maxwell	4	November 11, 2020	Seems pretty cool so far. Love the turn based action. Smooth frame rate. And the characters are just lovely in many different ways. Looking forward to what's next.
Korey Jones	5	November 11, 2020	Great!
Juank Perez	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game decent game.... well done characters
Tom Nguyen	1	November 11, 2020	Terrible rates.
zephule stargazer	1	November 11, 2020	This is 100% not f2p friendly, go play something else but just not this game.
Sopheab Bo	5	November 11, 2020	So far so good, I'm enjoying the storyline and game play. This app is very well designed. Thank you for keeping me interested. Keep up the good work developers.
Aaron Lynn	1	November 11, 2020	garbage.
Jesus dominguez	3	November 11, 2020	I installed the game but the audio was horrible it kept crackling but that might just be my phone
Pourab Das	3	November 11, 2020	Good game just needs to give more ways to earn genesis tarrots for f2p players..
Omne47	4	November 11, 2020	Send pretty good so far.
windarche	1	November 11, 2020	Cant reroll cause the game remember your guest account even after completely uninstalling and erasing all data
Joshua Cooper	5	November 11, 2020	Just started playing, really enjoying it right now.
Mr. September	3	November 11, 2020	Reskinned, anime version of Bait: Shadow Legends. Graphics are fine but it's as average as it can get in this oversaturated market.
NOVA DIAZ	5	November 11, 2020	Good
RagingSaiyan3 MCOC/DBZ	5	November 11, 2020	I dont even need to play to know it will be amazing...might need patches but what game doesn't! I've played some of your other games and thats why i already like this one.
Ixxen Angora	1	November 11, 2020	Actual garbage. Game has several banners to pull from, a majority requiring tickets you can only get with IRL MONEY, which the JP/CN version did not have. A shameful cash grab aimed at global players. Don't spend a cent here; game will rightfully die within the year.
Jose Alvarado	5	November 11, 2020	Fun
Not Interested	1	November 11, 2020	Oh my my, Insane amount of greed, cheap microtransactions barriers put in to the in game progression. Buy forceful monthly package system to just to unlock skip in resource stages? What! That's unbelievable. Stay away from this game, I repeat STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.
Runt Vision	3	November 11, 2020	After a few hours of game play, it's clear. Maybe in a few months the paywall will be decreased, but, only time will tell. Another gacha hero collector that makes it clear there will be no strategy over $. That being said, it's definitely worth a try if you like the turn based hero collector and don't mind progressing whenever. Visually appealing, runs smooth. Between the level based co-op, time based co-op and inaccessible banner summons/P2W summon cards, it's just not the game for me
Jose Valadez	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome game
Mr me 554	5	November 11, 2020	Good game
Juicy_ Box	5	November 11, 2020	I'd recommend this game to people if they know how to play any type of game like this, 10/10 flawless game I do see a few thing that can be fixed but I'm sure you developers can already see
Woolfish	1	November 11, 2020	mandatory daily event is set on 4-5 AM for european players
Tristan San Juan	1	November 11, 2020	They literally just launch already money hungry. Next few multiple summons is fix guarantee ssr first summon and 1 will always be no ssr. Ive rerolled 20 account at this time. Pretty characters to try sell just game they reskin to pick up intial money shorter version of raid of shadow lol gl. This company never learn in their greedy ness. Such bad rate for hero collector that requires you to have multiple copy of your rare heroes to get it to full potential. Save time... there are many game as pretty, better rates, less money grab. You would think they learn from langrisser
Praveen .M	5	November 11, 2020	So far, soo good
Aesthetic Culture	5	November 11, 2020	Its outstanding I love it so far
Lyra Mishimoto	5	November 11, 2020	The quality of the game is really good and the animations are so adorable! It is a turnbased game but i like that it isnt really an autoplay game either. 😊
Christopher Spesert	2	November 11, 2020	It's okay. A lot of the negative comments about paywall is true. Also, pretty abrupt stat checks around level 25. I was flying through the main story and suddenly enemy stats went way up. They REALLY want to you to pay. And unless you're willing to pay a lot, it's not worth it. I payed 30 and it was a waste IMO. Other companies do it better. I'd wait on it.
Beasle Sop	5	November 11, 2020	Not very far in yet but based on just gameplay, graffics, art style, character design and stabillity, it deserves 5★.
Blong Thao	5	November 11, 2020	Just started, but visuals look great and battles are fun.
Kakke	1	November 11, 2020	"Game is p2w, good summons are locked behind pay wall and everyone gets locked behind same free summons. JP version is better and the global caters to whales. Their best reply? ""Dump time into it and you'll KINDA catch up to the whales but not really."" People play idle games and gachas because they don't have time to play a full game. Don't force people to grind hours and hours just to taste what a whale gets."
Donkey Kong	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome game User Friendly
Yamato/Senketsu	5	November 11, 2020	Thank you
Brandon Carter	5	November 11, 2020	Dope graphics and badass characters
VoidParadox	5	November 11, 2020	When I put this game on pre-order I didn't know the game would be this gorgeous! The fact this game is on a phone is crazy to me, looks so amazing!
D Kryder	5	November 11, 2020	Great story and characters. Give it a try
dillon jacobs	5	November 11, 2020	Good game f2p
Jonathan Rogers	5	November 11, 2020	Very Epic
Lallawmawma Jahau	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game
Cryonicprawn	5	November 11, 2020	Really good 3d graphics, and interface.
Main Vayne420	1	November 11, 2020	XD really how is this game good. The characters are so dull. The time locked events make it so u can't grind freely and that is a major mistake. Shut down inc fast lads.
Mohamed Magdy	5	November 11, 2020	The game is working fine by now but most important is the developers give us the support we need so the game gonna be better I believe the graphics is good and so the game play keep on guys
letsgo 2sleepy	5	November 11, 2020	Most download
chris mcallister	5	November 11, 2020	Sweet graphics and really fun new game!
Sir. Kevin	5	November 11, 2020	Honestly cool to have a 3D battle system, and a tiny bit of lag but it just came out. But the animations are quite decent.
DehaWee	3	November 11, 2020	Good game, i love it and donated some money in it but WHY time limited daily events are only open during 1 hour??? Its 5 AM for me and its impossible for me to make em regulary. There is a clearance limit anyway - 2 times, so why wont you make a second daily entry time with 12 hour difference??? (base - 21:00 - 22:00, so make pls second entry at 9:00 - 10:00 by server time)
Tony Squinz	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing game, Graphics are beatiful and the game is overall enjoyable.
Loren Chang	5	November 11, 2020	So far, pretty fun and good battle system
Dragon Forge	5	November 11, 2020	#1 anime fan
edu kondalu	4	November 11, 2020	Game looks good but you need to keep more types of rankings and also guild rankings, guild wars, arena
Anthony Moua	5	November 11, 2020	It's story is very good
Gilgamesh King of Heroes	5	November 11, 2020	So far I'm enjoying this game and it's a pretty solid gacha
Aaron murphy	1	November 11, 2020	No auto battle bad mobile design
legofoxy123 tik tok Acosta	5	November 11, 2020	It's a cool game
stick fight gamer	5	November 11, 2020	I Love it
mobile moba	1	November 11, 2020	Why lock blitz (swipe stages ) behind a monthly payment these devs are so hungry for money im not gonna set on my phone watching my team autoplay a stage all day Remove proof of valor is what im tryn to say and for new players seeing this review u cant grind with swipe function without paying money monthly and what im tryn to say to the dev that are playing dumb is remove proof of valor if i want to swipe a stage why would i have to buy a monthly subscription
Hyper Cargo149	5	November 11, 2020	This game has amazing visuals and it's fun to play but please can you introduce English voiceovers?
Grystor	1	November 11, 2020	Couldn't reroll since the guest account is locked to device is. Hard pass since I didn't get the start I wanted then.
David Elliott	5	November 11, 2020	Excellent
Craig Wilks	4	November 11, 2020	So far so good. Im going to give this game a chance, heard alot of negative feedback from the f2p players and well as your common players willing to spend. I will give it a shot and determine whether or its worthwhile
Agony Snap	1	November 11, 2020	Its just all around meh. It seems like a ripboff of exos heros, but done very poorly...
Escanor Tauros	3	November 11, 2020	I logged in at the day of server release and a couple hours after that it reset starting with the tutorial again what is this
luis de la cruz	5	November 11, 2020	So far im really excited playing this game!!
the dark galaxy	5	November 11, 2020	It's good but when I go back for some reason the title screen is all messed up and when I go into the game it kicks me out
Aubku ツ	5	November 11, 2020	I'm definitely enjoying the game so far!
Mad PhantomPixels	3	November 11, 2020	Look just stop with extended tutorials. Most folks have played games of this formula enough times to not need to be railroaded for a lengthy time through the same mechanics they have seen hundreds of times already. It's simple have an option to skip the tutorial at the start.
Sarah Wilson	5	November 11, 2020	I love the art and it's so interesting. It so hard to find good games these days.
Nick C	5	November 11, 2020	Fun simple, easy to get into to
TVG Chaotic	5	November 11, 2020	Love the game
Astaturl Celestia	1	November 11, 2020	Unable to finish transfer, fake reward TRASH GAME! waitiNg so long Bu still garbage.
Yan Rivera	5	November 11, 2020	The game plays and looks great .
Raul Rodriguez	4	November 11, 2020	its ok
Gospel死	5	November 11, 2020	great graphics and gameplay is fun as heck. 9/10
christopher martinez	5	November 11, 2020	Its fun
Carlos Dominguez	5	November 11, 2020	It's finally here! And it was worth the wait. It's already my favorite JRPG. Cell shaded graphics it's an excellent choice. Very deep, but the tutorial is extremely helpful. Enjoy!
shannon young	4	November 11, 2020	Just started out interesting game other wise I would never touched it
joe bowl	5	November 11, 2020	Fun game
Eikichi Twinkletoes	1	November 11, 2020	What a waste. It's a copy of any other p2p mobile rpg on market, all you waste time in stupid story and $hit, good players don't care about damn story but a good gameplay. Worst summon rate and you won't be able to play with your favorite heroes unless you spend huge amount of real money as there are no value packs. For your first 10x summon you get the same worst ssr hero over and over, tried on 5 different phones, 2nd 10x no ssr. No currency to buy card/shard, useless packs upto 100$. U decide
Mustafa Khaled	5	November 11, 2020	The game is Cute. At the beginning I thought it wasP2W because most of the summoning fields was with real money but I kept playing cause the game story made me laugh a bit. And I collected the pre register rewards and summoned like15times I got like 2SSR and 4SR and this is only the first day so the truth need to be said this game is fair and dose not oppres F2P Players and with the pre register and the first event it is like no difference between the both.the story rewards you alot of cards too
Lightning Darkness	5	November 11, 2020	Im loving it so far I just hope you guys don't let greed get the best of this game
The BirdIntern	5	November 11, 2020	"This game might be perfect. This isn't just another ""Raid"" clone, thank God. It's not a herum game with voluptuous anime women. This is a fun, sometimes goofy, very pretty, gatcha JRPG. I haven't found any downsides to the game yet and frankly I don't expect to. The story, dialogue, voices, animation, combat, rewards, characters, everything is on point here. Even skipping a story scene gives you a brief summary before you move on. Carefully thought out, well done game. 5/5 all the way."
Bot	5	November 11, 2020	Love it so far
Cheesepuff 727	4	November 11, 2020	Really liking it so far. Too early to give real opinion yet
Best Gamer	5	November 11, 2020	game story is great.world cool one game this year
Michael Shafer	3	November 11, 2020	It's a decent game, but for its size (1.3gb), I was expecting much more. Again, good game, but too big for too little. Uninstalled
Angel alcoser	5	November 11, 2020	Great game
TYLEE 3	4	November 12, 2020	So far so good I'm looking forward to seeing what the game offer's in the long run.
Dav-Voughn Thompson	4	November 12, 2020	Just started; feelsva little slow so far
Evan Scarbraugh	5	November 12, 2020	"Pretty decent. Tutorial isnt too bad. Dont care if its ""p2w"" cuz its fun lol"
Luis Obregon	5	November 12, 2020	Love the names in this game
Lifelink	1	November 12, 2020	Another boring turn-based mobile JRPG.
Wilfredo Garcia	4	November 12, 2020	Great game. The story is interesting and the art work is amazing keep up the good work.
Jordann Metal	5	November 12, 2020	The game play is really good so far and the graphics are A1
Matthew Bortell	3	November 12, 2020	The game is great but it has a major issue for me though. Not sure if it's my phone or not but summon animations as well as the arcane cannon event in between 2.3 and 2.4 do not show animations. More of a problem for the cannon as i can not see where the bullets are going and thus fail the event every time because of that you get 3 stars max as this leads me to believe there may be more events like this and my progross will become hindered. Edit: this was tried on both low and max settings.
Xavier Detter	5	November 12, 2020	Fun to play no lagging plays smoothly
Tatiana B	4	November 12, 2020	Trouble login. But once I get in I love the game amazing graphics
Nuno Braga	5	November 12, 2020	Enjoying the game a lot so far. As some new features that usually don't see in some other games of the same type. One thing called my attention, the hero Mary, a little girl in a wheelchair. I think is very good showing that we can make hero's on wheelchairs, shows equality. Loved that and on the game she kicks ass. Keep the good job and I hope you will keep improving the game.
Angelo Hurley	5	November 12, 2020	So far so good play lots of gacha and this one is fun so far just please don't get too greedy and we will continue to play.
Ren	1	November 12, 2020	Paywall Cashgrab Absolutely disgusting junk. If you are interested in this game, then do yourself a favour and dont even install it. The only way to roll on a event banner is through premium tickets, which are pay to win only for the most part. You might be able to get idk like 15 to 20 of these tickets TOTAL as a purely f2p user. They are not cheap as well. One 10 pull with no discount will cost you 28 dollars US. Update: in response to automated response, if u f2p user just play other games .
Ihavenoidea whattonamemyaccount	3	November 12, 2020	Ok. Theres a quest that's really laggy, the one which you're supposed to shot down enemies-but I cant complete that no matter how hard I try because the way the stupid thing is designed is with a joystick and it consistently freezes up. Please fix this
Jose Salazar	5	November 12, 2020	Wonderful game outstanding
hugh mungus	5	November 12, 2020	Lit
bluestratos1901	5	November 12, 2020	Fun so far
J Thompson	5	November 12, 2020	Text is a small and the battle field is too close but other 👍🏾👍🏾
Dennis Stewart	5	November 12, 2020	Pretty damm good of a game graphics like dragon raja or cod cold war
Kevin Nguyen	1	November 12, 2020	I signed up for Guest account because I want to see how I like the game before I bind my account. I played through Chapter one and thought that it was a great game. Then when I went to bind my account, ALL my data got erased in the guest account. It had many grinded items that I lost with a click of a button.
Joseph Barttelt	5	November 12, 2020	Fun game try it out
Sweet Guy	5	November 12, 2020	Love it
Richard Beare	5	November 12, 2020	Really awesome game! Love the graphics and storyline!
Brittany Bergantzel	5	November 12, 2020	It's a lot of fun
EZee Pz	1	November 12, 2020	Absolutely p2w game
ChurchBoy P Prince Johnson	5	November 12, 2020	great game so far
E Bee	1	November 12, 2020	Daily quest requires you to spend in order to get final reward, and also your really just running auto at every fight. Really took 2 step backs with this one when compared to where Langrisser is today.
Sean Eccleston	5	November 12, 2020	Fun
Joe Warren	5	November 12, 2020	Amazing graphics, great gameplay and easy to learn. I love this game.
Dork Cabildo	5	November 12, 2020	Waifuuuuu
Fo Davoh	5	November 12, 2020	Like it so far vot my frist ssr after the beg
Arki W	5	November 12, 2020	really enjoying the game play its easy fun and has good story line
Jamison Shock	4	November 12, 2020	Enjoying the game do far.
Aynimalyi Comics	1	November 12, 2020	Is a good game but rate up banners are hard cash locked.. events a paying player this is stupid. 5 star once this changes!
Joshua Jarels	1	November 12, 2020	Heros locked behind paid only currency. This could have been an enjoyable game.
Joshua Davis	1	November 12, 2020	"GoGS is yet another pointless faux-strategy, faux-RPG game where the strategy is non-existant and the RPG is bogged down in micromanagement of worthless, dev-created resources. That - and the abysmally bad energy system - ensures that you won't get to ""play"" much at all. This game will turn into work in a matter of days. Do yourself a favor and just pass this one by. EDIT: Your response is a copy-paste lie in hopes of getting other people to try the game. How about actually doing something?"
Saweverything	5	November 12, 2020	Entertaining and good character design.
Daniel Newell	5	November 12, 2020	First to the key!
dale blouin	5	November 12, 2020	awesome game!
Kelly Evans	3	November 12, 2020	Just been playing a couple of minutes, looks good so far, but not yet feeling the, excitement to keep playing. If it gets better, imI will update my rating.
Rich Jones	5	November 12, 2020	Great so far. Gorgeous visuals and the best story telling in any game like this to date.
Jester	5	November 12, 2020	Just opened the game and started playing a bit. Enjoying it so far. The art and graphics are very good. I love the battle animations, too. Already pulled an SSR with my free 10x summon. Game looks very promising at the moment. Only thing I noticed is a funny glitch in cutscene with a dinner tray falling out of nowhere? Other than that, everything runs pretty smooth.
George Whitman	5	November 12, 2020	its a good game.
Tokanova Tokanova	5	November 12, 2020	Got an SSR on my first ten pull. POG.
Nyhmz	1	November 12, 2020	Forced male MC, I don't want male characters in my gacha games. Stay away from this if you want waifus. I want to be able to play a Female main character, the game is FORCING me to play the male character and I don't want a male character interacting with my waifus.
James Krik	1	November 12, 2020	I lost interest before the intro finished because immediately there were sound errors but mostly due to the Marco Polo character a little girl with a stuffed panda isn't exactly what I would prefer to focus on at games start in a combat game. I don't know what's up with anime and little girls that end up in love with adult men or children being in combat or adult situations but I disapprove. Children should be children not treated as adults it's too pedo-centric for me thanks but no thanks.
Vritra- 4	5	November 12, 2020	Fun game love the style and game play
kiva seiei	2	November 12, 2020	Forn the small tome i was playind it was fun but it is more P2W ther some F2P option
Dion Owens	1	November 12, 2020	I cant log in to the game why is server under maintenence
Raul F. Garcia-Sanchez	1	November 12, 2020	Trash mobile game that is done infinitely better in other mobile games. It bound my Google account by force despite signing in as a guest. There was a Facebook event that allowed for 2 initial pulls outright and now its gone. The first ssr banner pull is slanted towards the unit with an event that requires you to spend money to get more shards. You cannot get rate ups without spending money. Mobile games can be predatory. This one is outright trying to scam you. Be forewarned.
Pheng Namikaze Her	4	November 12, 2020	Simple and easy. Cool turn based gamplay.
Chris Young	5	November 12, 2020	be back later having fun
Ali ZSX	5	November 12, 2020	Very amazing game, love the graphics and way the fighting style works, I love everything about it but too much paid stuff yet genesis cards are basically premium and or hard to get, I hope you make exclusive events and more newer characters and story, im so looking forward to such a game to develope, oh and since this game just came out in this region or store can you add gift codes since I couldn't get any because it was pre registered. Thanks for the game I will play it gladly.
Micheal	1	November 12, 2020	Rate up banner by cash only, QOL lock behind money, limited time challenge that u need to open the game in specific time of day to do it
Bram	4	November 12, 2020	Amazing game but it wont load anymore and there is a permanent checker board pattern on the start screen
nick roach	5	November 12, 2020	This game is fantastic very f2p friendly,I literally pulled an ssr character on my free daily summon which is crazy so all In all great game.
Tyrek Brewer	5	November 12, 2020	Amazing
Torie Augello	5	November 12, 2020	Loop
Billy Chapman	5	November 12, 2020	Good if you like this kind of game
Ryuichito	5	November 12, 2020	Excellent visuals, music, and just overall seems very polished. Will see how it goes as i play more.
Matthew Mcmanus	5	November 12, 2020	Great game...great graphics....some vip feel but i gave up seven knights after playing for years for this....i dont regret it
Bryan Luna	1	November 12, 2020	Greedy game
Robert Bemis	5	November 12, 2020	Enjoying the experience so far.
IsaiahmartinOnXgameZ Gaming	3	November 12, 2020	I try to download the game on play store but it's not working... Also It's actually really cute when u say chosen one to people.. :I
John Mckelvey	5	November 12, 2020	Beautiful storyline. Great graphics. Easy to learn and decent summon rate. Could make it a little easier to get stuff to do summons with but no real complaints. Will definitely be playing a lot.
WILLIAM Bonar	5	November 12, 2020	i love it
Jared Hernandez	5	November 12, 2020	Amazing game im surprised it's that good for a new game.
meso thelio	4	November 12, 2020	its pretty ok , everything's p easy to understand and the storyline is alright. animation is pretty bad But for when its paired with the dialog boxes it looks nice. stand alone isnt too great. wish theyd add facial expressions or like the mouths moving then again whenever there Are times where someone moves their mouth its weird and outta place. either way fun to play!
Damaged Axel	4	November 12, 2020	So far love this game but for the love of god fix cupid's cutscene animations. When she moves her arm it looks like satan has posessed her serving dish to the left of the screen
Fernando Cosme	5	November 12, 2020	Great game
wolf of death	5	November 12, 2020	Best graphics ever for a. Mobile game
Edward Kim	4	November 12, 2020	So far, so good. I wish there was an auto button for the text though
Accel Meta	5	November 12, 2020	So far I'm liking it
セイバーワンスアンドフューチャーキング	5	November 12, 2020	Good enough to make me happy and enjoy at work and home.
BENJAMIN BENJAMIN	1	November 12, 2020	Good game, but where the hell is the fan service at for the boys and the jiggle physics!? What a let down!
Jimmy Brite	4	November 12, 2020	Its fun
Andy Kang	5	November 12, 2020	Great graphics and character
Justin Ruffner	5	November 12, 2020	👍
sean barlow	5	November 12, 2020	Very good game like it so far!
Robert Gadziemski	1	November 12, 2020	Just not really a fun game in general. Horrible Summon system with a huge paywall. I will pass on this mess.
Anime Demon	5	November 12, 2020	Had problems there but the dev team worked on iy quickly and fixed the problem. Great graphics, great movment, great sound and animations its fun.
Joy Raito	5	November 12, 2020	Naisu
Killer Vampiers	5	November 12, 2020	I really love this game great graphics really fun game 🙂
Spencer Price	5	November 12, 2020	Seems alright so far.
Tommy	5	November 12, 2020	Had some trouble installing, but got a fast response from the developers, after download everything works fine. Thank you for the great support!
CJ Nealy	5	November 12, 2020	So far so good. The graphics are nice, I like the character designs a lot, and the game play is solid. As far as the gacha... It's gacha. There's also several monthly paid passes, one which is a lifetime pass. Too early to tell if it's heavy pay to win but seems fair so far.
jacob eichacker	5	November 12, 2020	Lul
Linda Ceccato	4	November 12, 2020	Pretty good thanks
Mars	1	November 12, 2020	Rate up banners can only be rolled with premium currency. Absolutely awful.
King Oblivious	5	November 12, 2020	Epic game I enjoy
joslin smith	3	November 12, 2020	I love the graphics of the game and how it plays, but the gotcha summoning for the Genesis tickets are kinda outrageous. Like I know you have a chance to get the summon in a normal gotcha but you have to save up for years it seems to even do a Genesis ticket summon or you just have to pay your way to do it.
Kirin	4	November 12, 2020	Its a great game but I wish I could have picked a Male or Female protagonist
Ruben Pliego	5	November 12, 2020	The graphics in the game are amazing
Vaporeonplays 59	3	November 12, 2020	it kicks me out of the game after the loading is done please fix this
Kurogane	4	November 12, 2020	I'm genuinely surprised by how good it is. I don't expect much from turn based rpgs but this and Exos Heroes are exceptional. The graphics are really good, amazing story and the gacha is very generous too. I literally got 2 SSR characters and 3 SR on my first day. I haven't really come across any bugs either yet, I have given one less star cause I personally don't like turn based games but overall this is pretty good and I think I'll stay
Jake Rudy	3	November 12, 2020	Will update when I play more.
Jeremy Gallagher	5	November 12, 2020	Enjoy this game
Dana Bragg	1	November 12, 2020	DO NOT DOWNLOAD this game stole my card info after I downloaded it and I had $117 used halfway across the US to buy a damned coffee pot. Do not download this it's just a gimic to steal your money, LITERALLY.
Himanshi 00	5	November 12, 2020	Vansh
Dr ACE	5	November 12, 2020	I would love if they made an actual anime out of this causes it's so good I'd definitely watch it.
Антон Тарасов	1	November 12, 2020	We need server with GMT+ time! this CST sucks, half of all events in the middle of the night!
Daniel Pointer	5	November 12, 2020	One of the better gatcha games that I've played. Summon rate is fair. Genesis tickets are premium, but you gain a lot of other summon tickets just by playing the story. Genesis tickets are only if you want a specific element. Good story and animations. Give it a chance! ☺
Luis Rodriguez	5	November 12, 2020	Best gametos ever!
Arcylzer DarkStone	1	November 12, 2020	"when you level up to 25 and complete map 8th in basic and elite, things getting hard and if you dont pay and get SSR and high material things you will be gonna be ""ME"" and uninstall the pre-register the game and never come back ! GOGS = Pay to win"
adarsh vk	3	November 12, 2020	"Today I Purchased ETERNAL BLESSING for $ 14.99 and already paid.. But it's showing its "" not activated"" can you rectify this problem"
eldon brunton	5	November 12, 2020	Nice
Charles Pierre	1	November 12, 2020	I own 5 gears of ssr rank and still the trial is not complete. They rig it so you can spend money. Scam. They rid they angelic trial so people can spend money. That is pathetic.
CJ MY BOY	3	November 12, 2020	The voice acting is disappear in game in act 3 of the story
Belinda Wolter	1	November 12, 2020	Just like every other gacha collection 'game'. Tons of IAP needed to unlock a lot of features. Progress in the story stages to unlock instances that are the same as other games. Constant grind revolving around the same battles repeated hundreds of times a day to complete daily stuff. Absolutely nothing new or interesting. Even the story (be a hero who saves an empress girl from evil people who claim her empire is the actual evil people and then go around trying to stop them) is done to death.
Meraldo Rodríguez	5	November 12, 2020	I play is awesome amazing I love the game
Sinonuim	5	November 12, 2020	Awesome
Jeremy Ahrendt	5	November 12, 2020	I actually really enjoy the game but it recently deleted all of my progress.
Fate Legend	3	November 12, 2020	The game is good but the writing is too small to read and doesn't have a log button to read back on dialogue. Secondly the sound sync is off with what the charcters are saying.
Dr. Awesome	1	November 12, 2020	Nope, thats it im done. All of the progress I've made was deleted for literally no reason, and yes this data was synced with my fb account. Im very angry rn, so don't expect me to come back.
Lucas Agrelly	5	November 12, 2020	Good
Joshua Finlayson	5	November 13, 2020	Awesome
Jerico Mendez	5	November 13, 2020	very good fighting and story it looked boring at first but when i battled it was amazin my favorite is marco polo so install right now
ANIME VIKING	5	November 13, 2020	Well how to start is amazing game one of the top games I have try
Kevin Song	1	November 13, 2020	Rate up banners use tickets bought from store only. Doesn't matter how any events you do to give these tickets out. The fact that you cant farm summon tickets for rate up banners killed this game before it even started
1 -800-inosuke	5	November 13, 2020	Fun
Jakub B.	3	November 13, 2020	This game is decent... for American players. However Europeans are at large disadvantage because timed challenges are set to 5 am of European time. =_=
Andrew Spice	4	November 13, 2020	Pretty good, controls are easy and graphics are good.
Supedoodle	5	November 13, 2020	Idk
impasta man	5	November 13, 2020	The graphics needs more improvement
rashad nader	1	November 13, 2020	this is Langrissers version 2.0 with a different battle style, yep same gasha you saw before nothing fresh or new with the same low drop rate summons that takes a life time to collecte with no pitty milage and the same shard system in Langrisser and almost the same dailys with an overprice tag...yay
Lawren Moore	5	November 13, 2020	The characters and graphics are awesome
Justin s	4	November 13, 2020	Great all around, amazing graphics if your phone can run it. I give it 4 stars because the PVP only allows 5 times per day, after that cost gems. It should regen at least 1 battle every hour to engage players more.
Rikan Khaos	1	November 13, 2020	Game is lame and for just being released like any other mobile game it is here to exploit your wallet. Nothing fun about it unless you like giving away money. Bet there will as well be some generic reaponse like the rest something around that yes they have a cash shop for blah blah reason. But you can do blah blah to keep up with the whales.
Lee Montville	5	November 13, 2020	Game is great keep it up love playing the game
Jason Peters	5	November 13, 2020	This game is awsome
Con Kam	5	November 13, 2020	I like this game. I've been able to summon SSR characters with free tickets. There is no need for a whole SSR team to make progress.
christian lopez	5	November 13, 2020	The animation and graphics and are all just beautiful 🤩🤩🤩🤩
cat god	5	November 13, 2020	Im giving a good rating but i havent played game
Tyliek Williams	5	November 13, 2020	Best rpg ever!!😄
jung yang	4	November 13, 2020	Nice 👌
Jamie Tanasiuk	1	November 13, 2020	You can use a gacha system for characters, or you can use it for gear but not for both. This makes your game far too inaccessible for ftp, light spenders. Not worth the time investment imo. Zlong has a rep for milking their players for progression, I'd skip this one.
lesley webb	5	November 13, 2020	Im rating this off of potential, now this is what should be fixed, please add more varriety to the game just seems like spamming aoes is the way to win, Give ultinates more visual effects instead of black screening actually show the enemys and your character attacking them. Voice acting would have made me pay attention to the story a majority of players will skip it. I will update my review after a couple of weeks of playing.
Roy Taylor	3	November 13, 2020	Not bad but not great. Seems like a good way to spend money at this point. Might come back after it's been around a little longer to see if the P2W goes away.
The Gamer Bros	5	November 13, 2020	The graphics are great and no delay and the story is very new to me so im enjoying it
Guns vs. Kombat 2	2	November 13, 2020	The game is really fun but the events are really annoying. They require you to log on in a certain time or else you can't play the event. Also, you need to do 1 of the events to get Lucifer, an op assasin character. Please change the events to not have a required time for you to log in. I really love this game and will update my review to 5 stars if this gets fixed.
Yasin Avcı	5	November 13, 2020	Merhaba server saati (GMT +7) olduğundan etkinlikleri kaçırıyoruz ya etkinlikleri gün boyu yapın yada aktif süreyi 1 saatten uzun yapın.
Gerald Schultz	5	November 13, 2020	Good game nice collection of heros
Rogers Brown	4	November 13, 2020	The game has great character designs and the gameplay is engaging with plenty of strategy. Summons as free to play are not the best as there is a premium ticket predominantly gained through cash in the shop, but the game has a soft hidden guaranteed SSR on first 10 pull and a decent amount of free tickets. Has a nice lifetime pakage for summon tickets and some quality of life but other quality of life features are still fairly heavily monetized.
firestorm	5	November 13, 2020	its just one big bag of awesomeness filled with even more awesomeness
Elmo	5	November 13, 2020	Pretty good so far
Travis Lee	5	November 13, 2020	Beautiful game
AlwayzFind AWay	5	November 13, 2020	Loving so far
Chris Sansoucie	4	November 13, 2020	Just started haven't seen much yet, it seems to cover basic functions, graphics arent half bad, and mechanics are easy to figure out from what i've seen so far. Will potentially move to 5 stars after expierencing more than a tutorial, one mission, and a summon session before it ask me to rate the game.
JoAnn O'Brien	5	November 13, 2020	The intro video quality was a bit disappointing but so far that is my only negative comment. The immersive storyline and characterization brings you into a fantasy world in anime style. I really liked how most of the female characters are more modestly clothed. Most games made female clothing and anatomy sexualitzed but this one offers a more practical style of clothing that would be easy to fight in for real life battles. I love the humor that goes into the storyline. Great job!
Joey Jones	5	November 13, 2020	Pretty good so far
Hunter Jones	5	November 13, 2020	Awesome
Royal Spurlin	5	November 13, 2020	Good game so far
Leontin Mihai	5	November 13, 2020	This game is the best, I really enjoy it, it does require to play daily and to play like 1-2 hours at day, but you will not regret it. About the P2W game, I didn't spend a cent and yet I have no problems going throw the campaign or stuff like that, the SSR heroes rate seems quite good, I wasn't expecting to receive so many. And another thing, I think the time is messed up, I cannot partecipate to some events because of the CST time, I'm from Romania and the difference in time is quite a few hour
Samuel Burton	2	November 13, 2020	Was okay for the first hour or two after that you cant even play it. The opponents are impossible to beat and they only provide enough for maybe three summons.
HardCorelGamer	5	November 13, 2020	This Game Is Bad A$$ I Love It So Much Im Hooked So Much To Do And Earn There Battle Pass Is Full Of Such Cool Rewards And Seems Like Earning Heros/Gear Seems Pretty Easy I Hope They Stay Free 2 Play Friendy And Don't Shy Away From That
Billy Scott	2	November 13, 2020	Story feels rushed and is overall rather boring. Characters aren't interesting either
Darth Caedus	5	November 13, 2020	Great game so far!!
Jim Shattuck	4	November 13, 2020	Everything got fixed quickly and as for the game, so far so good.
Brayan Santana	4	November 13, 2020	Good game and story
lala diablo	5	November 13, 2020	loving it, but wish i got my line-up for the beta test. but the game is still awesome!!!!!
Meeki Kazi Official	4	November 13, 2020	From what I have played so far I think it is decent even if I may have hit a wall I'm not mad about that because I mostly don't play a single gacha game all day & and I'm more of f2p. My main complaint is the Gensis Tarot Cards with them being hard to get other than events or paying with real money. Other than that as of the game right now it's fine I won't be to harsh on it since just launched for Global.
Aniket Soni	5	November 13, 2020	Thanks for updating the servers , and i like it graphic and user interface. Just a recommendation please make a place where the player can test skills of the owned summons heros
John Rodis	4	November 13, 2020	At the moment of writing this, I've played for 3 days. The game runs well, without any crashes, the menus load fast and the free pulls are plenty. The only issue I have is that certain challenges are only available during a time in the day, 5 a.m. in my timezone, so it's impossible for me to play. They should be available for at least 12 hours since the game is worldwide and everyone must be able to join the challenges.
Tennessee Theimer	2	November 13, 2020	With all the awesome graphics was a waste not.being a rpg.
Darren Turner	5	November 13, 2020	Beautiful Gameplay
joão pedro	5	November 13, 2020	played for 10 minutes. good game so far.
Andrew Brockman	5	November 13, 2020	Great graphics, straight forward gameplay. Easy to pick up and enjoy.
Michael Elliott	1	November 13, 2020	After reading about all the pay to win I don't even want to download it I understand developers need to make money too but this is to much. Gen tickets shouldn't be locked behind a pay wall or event but something you can earn overtime regularly while being given the option to pay for more if you wanted not because you have to in order to play this game is a hard pass for me.
Bala Krishnan	5	November 13, 2020	Graphics effects awesome and very cool
SAV Demores	3	November 13, 2020	Game is decent try it. However the $1 monthly subscription is garbage. Eternal blessing is a good though. If we cant blitz the challenges let auto ai repeat after losing. That should not be locked. Sharing pity between all hero banners is nice. More event with gensis as the rewards please. Rank level up ones don't count. Overall I like & enjoy the game and hope it's goes towards a good direction as I do plan on staying. 3 stars atm but I hope I come back here to change it once it gets better.
TheKillingBat -Gaming	5	November 13, 2020	Game seems great, but I first did account transfer from my phone and computer when i started but tonight I was having problems with the PC transfer. I lost the account instead of it transfering. But I still have the account on my phone atleast so I didn't lose everything. ( Nevermind I found out there are more than 1 servers
lisa thrasher	4	November 13, 2020	Loving it so far! The graphics are awesome and love the conversations between heroes. LOVE that it walks you through things first then lets you do it. It's not hard to understand like some games.
Prabhan Bal	5	November 13, 2020	I like it
PerplexedPotato	5	November 13, 2020	Nice art style
Anthony Albano	5	November 13, 2020	It's great
James Linstrum	4	November 13, 2020	Everyone complaining about the p2w aspect to the game. Yes the rates aren't that high but this isn't exactly a play for 20 minutes and leave kind of game. If you're not ready to grind then find another game. I'm completely f2p except I just bought the pass and have maybe 2 levels on it. I've managed to get all SR characters below and 2 SSR characters in 4 days. I grinded and I think that's fair. The rates for genesis tickets could be better for how difficult it is to acquire them. Love the game
James Sharpe	5	November 13, 2020	Really wierd way of asking todo a review lol But overall a grest game similar to LORDS OF HEROS but much more toon graphics and i lpve both
Domokos Győrfi	4	November 13, 2020	Really love the game so far. Nice graphics even on the lowest settings which can improve fps by a lot. Very short loading time is a huge plus for me. Although the upgrade options for the heroes and your team can be overwhelming. Too many options and too many resources for them. And PLEASE add more open time for Timed Challenges. The 1 hour window is really short especially when it's based on server time. I wasn't able to do them yet due the time zone restriction and I need them for the quests.
Eleni Walsh	4	November 13, 2020	A pretty basic, yet fun gacha game overall. The character design is nice and the gameplay keeps me entertained for hours. My only gripes are that when I want to type something into a description box (example: guild motto or my personal card message) I keep getting notified that I'm using invalid or banned characters, even a simple punctuation mark is considered not allowed. Also, there's a bug where Cupid's platter does the cha-cha during cutscenes.
Trev Dew	2	November 13, 2020	Gameplay is fine, story and characters are nice.. but these gacha games with low rates, and extremely low ways to obtain obtain currency should stop. Update: Used over 170 cards for the basic hero summon, got 4 new SR characters and the rest were duplicates. 0 SSR. Used 40 genesis cards and got 1 new SR and the rest were all duplicate, 0 SSR. Not playing a game with rates this low.. and yes events sure help when it's MOSTLY spending events.
Laura Trevino	5	November 13, 2020	It's good so far just started this evening
John Smith	4	November 13, 2020	Diamond in the rough in every regard. A game with a unique 3d combat system featuring dozens of very well designed characters, with voice acting for all npc lines I've so far seen (expens.). The current launch has been quite generous to me in regards to incentives, and I've had a fun time playing so far. This isn't to say the game is without fault, some meshing issues on models, and rough graphics are immediately noticeable and are my only complaint; for a game still in pre-reg, much potential!
Clovr	4	November 13, 2020	Nice Game.
bimbo	3	November 13, 2020	typical zlong. edit: despite knowing i'm sending words into the void with no chance of anybody actually reading them, i'll respond anyway -- you guys really put a timer on yourselves making the galaxy tickets virtually unobtainable unless money is spent. you could eeeeeeasily remedy the major criticism about this game with one easy change; make galaxy tickets purchasable using premium currency. make them expensive if you want! we just need a way to obtain them.
Eagel cat22	5	November 13, 2020	the game can always be improved I enjoy the features but I believe all the features can be improved exponentially in the gameplay as well
Norat Maaz	2	November 14, 2020	sorry i like gacha game and i am a F2P player so this game is not for me
Joseph Ad	4	November 14, 2020	Good game but i can definitely see why people say there is a paywall.
Matthew Green	5	November 14, 2020	I just started playing and it is somewhat interesting. It was alot of reading at first but it was dope. If they would have made the cutscenes an anime that would have been dope. But overall its not bad.
Miguel Thinks	4	November 14, 2020	The story is great and gameplay is great so far. My only little issue is some of the transition mechanics. Like when you retreat from a battle, it just abruptly takes you back the previous screen, without any fancy transition or consequence. Not a big deal, but just feels too abrupt, as if nothing ever happened.
Rinka Eruru	5	November 14, 2020	So far no probs
falber gasted	5	November 14, 2020	This is my new favorite mmo
Sam Barber	1	November 14, 2020	By
Ronald Brewer	5	November 14, 2020	Good so far
Lea M	5	November 14, 2020	OMG! I'm definitely addicted to this game. Execution of the game is incredible... Characters, gameplay, graphics, controls are impressive in my opinion. At this point I have not see any issues. Oh, and how could I forget... the storyline is incredible in itself.
Cabal Gamez	5	November 14, 2020	So far this is a fun game. Looks good too
Jay Roberts	5	November 14, 2020	Trial for now
That one Hybrid	5	November 14, 2020	Really great game, I like how its harder to get SSR characters. It was a little to easy to get them during Beta testing.
Jason Lo	3	November 14, 2020	It's not a bad game, but around level 25, resources start to dwindle. You won't be able to summon as often so if your earlier summons weren't great, it's not worth continuing.
dinysaur Carr	5	November 14, 2020	I love RPG games like this.
Matthew Beim	5	November 14, 2020	Great game
TheBlack Swan33	4	November 14, 2020	Very good game but unfortunately the server schedule blocks the progress of 90% of the game population. Do something !
Tommy Shepherd	5	November 14, 2020	Until I can get my account back it's one star. I was playing since it opened this morning and then switched voices in middle of fight and it asked me to restart game. I did. It deleted my account. I spent 80 bucks and now cannot access account.
Ethan Phoenix	5	November 14, 2020	I'm enjoying playing atm.
Daniel Sharp	2	November 14, 2020	The characters look like low quality. There is no option to turn up graphics as far as I can tell. You cannot preview any characters that you have not summoned. And the characters also seem to be what I would label as 2.5d not 3d. They are kinda like a mix between hand drawn with cg animations. Edit: I found the graphics option, after turning everything to max the game looked exactly the same.

alex trebelhorn	4	November 14, 2020	Good
Ramces Perez	4	November 14, 2020	good game
Raed Assaf	3	November 14, 2020	Nice game but it overheats my phone
Dillon Tieu	4	November 14, 2020	Cool concept great game, it's really cool to see famous characters, I'm a free player, and I thought the rates were pretty good, pulled 2 ssrs and plenty of srs within the beginning of the game, plenty of people talk about the paywall but forgetting that it is a free to play game, it's completely optional to pay to win, a journey of a free to play player is never easy but I'm enjoying the game for what it is now, can't wait to see more characters and more synergy moves with the ones I have now.
Demonic Grim	4	November 14, 2020	Fun game. I like the design and graphics of the characters.
Juice Bee	5	November 14, 2020	❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎
Jeffrey Hoover	4	November 14, 2020	Only 4 because i havent played much yet but so far its great
curtis bliss	5	November 14, 2020	The game is almost nostalgic in a way because it has various characters that are from various fairy tales that I was told as a child. Not only does this game have a competitive feeling to it but also has a homy feeling to it that keeps you coming back and playing.
Tenkai - Mobile Gaming	5	November 14, 2020	Insane game
Matt Mertens	5	November 14, 2020	Really great graphics.
Gamer 2005	5	November 14, 2020	Playing it so far it is a really good game and want to see the future updates
My_Name_Is_ Aries	4	November 14, 2020	I'm thing the game is good and all but the joint strikes r not working for me and it need to have more exp for missions
Devreaux Simpson	5	November 14, 2020	Great game so far
beansand farts	5	November 14, 2020	Great so far look forward to playing a long time
Joey Romanazzi's	1	November 14, 2020	Too much pay to win ruining the game. Respond as you will, but pay to win is blatantly ruining games on all forms of gaming.
Smol Beans	5	November 14, 2020	I've waited for the game to launch and si far I can say that it didn't disappoint me one bit 😊💞
James Trifiletti	2	November 14, 2020	The game gets near impossible around level 26. The only way to progress normally is to buy the gear or characters. Combat is a 5/10 because i can just press auto and the best outcome is played out. A let down if anything.
It's Schulzy	4	November 14, 2020	Great! It don't have an issue doing lots of summons + good combat/graphics. However, it has two major flaws. First, joint strikes are only available for 1 hour every day. This is ridiculous. At least give us a 3 hour time-frame minimum. Second, you can not do auto repeat for certain challenges. This is also ridiculous and inconsiderate of the players time. If they fix these two issues, I doubt this game will die and it will be super fun. If they don't, expect a shutdown in the next 6 months
Uncle Ben	5	November 14, 2020	Love the game very nice graphics

DEOEXOTICS	5	November 3, 2020	it's cool super laggy

Lele Morgan	2	November 3, 2020	Its to laggy fix your ad and the lag and you get a 5 star review
Austin Freeze	4	November 3, 2020	Love the game and can't wait for the updates to come. The reason it's 4 stars is only because there are no sounds in the game... And it's a little touchy sometimes, but other than that love the game.
Abrianna Benson	4	November 3, 2020	yes good game but why does it have to have the same hero powers? it gets boring for me!

SoloSkywalker01	3	November 7, 2020	The game is great aside from the constant bugging. It buggs out and lags multiple times each run. It freezes then picks back up. It doesn't lag to the point it makes me die but its still annoying. And there are no sounds. Adding sounds would make this so much more enjoyable. And the ads are not overboard. I love that a lot

Itz Terra	2	October 6, 2018	ARRRGHHHH!!! The bots trigger me! I get that there aren't many players, but facing bots 99.5% of the time isn't satisfying. So far I've only played against a human once. I could tell because of how 1. It only took an instant to find a match 2. The exact same noob profile photo and taunts as me and 3. The lag; there was delay for the opponents reactions. The bots are not like this, basically being identical to training mode. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars

10 FACTS WORLDWIDE	5	November 6, 2020	I registered early but i didnt get my 1000 coins plz help😭.
Bernie Myszkowski	3	November 6, 2020	I got so hyped for this game but I was disappointed that you need internet to play the game. I think there should be an option to play online as a different game mode.
Sahil Bhandari	5	November 6, 2020	less buggy good optimization no lags overall very excellent
Sourav Satvaya	4	November 6, 2020	Working fine. Need some polish & UI improvements. Home screen icons & texts are too small, animations are not that good. Hope you'll fix these things. Thank you. ❤️

zkuywalker	2	November 6, 2020	Why i must online when im Login the game, i dont have internet connection at every time, so please just make it offline when im Login the game...
Abishek Chauhan	5	November 6, 2020	Nice
Nitesh Sharma	4	November 6, 2020	Please do offline
Gelan lennon Garner	5	November 6, 2020	I like how it had so much changes from the first one and the multiplayer aspects of the game made it more fun to play and less lonely unlike the first one.
Simon	4	November 6, 2020	Truly entertaining slicing game, just fix the bugs and add more features maybe offline😎👍
Virone Pagcaliwagan	4	November 6, 2020	The game is overall fun, the graphics improved from the previous version, but my only concern is. When cutting the fruit, I don't feel the same satisfaction as the old fruit ninja, you guys are trying to make it look cleaner, which kinda looks stiff/unatural when cutting the fruit. All in all happy you guys made a fruit ninja 2, keep up the good work!
DESTROYER GAMING	5	November 6, 2020	It's like clash royale and clash of clans.There are upgrades and 1v1 battle like Clash royale.Season challenge is diffilcult.And,we can choose avatar like Mini Militia,a battle royale game.But it is much better than FRUIT NINJA.Thanks for bringing unexpected sequel.KEEP GOING👍👍👍

Nissi Prakash Yellisetty	5	November 6, 2020	Yes yes yes i am waiting for fruit ninja ,3
ankush singh	5	November 6, 2020	As expected game is amazing. I played fruit ninja and now fruit ninja 2. They amazingly change many things, contols are more accurate, graphics are awesome, lobby, sound, music, characters, concept is amazing. And best part they added multiplayer system which is surprisingly amazing. After PUBG we all wanted a multiplayer mode. Keep updating the game. Great job halfbrick.
Jacob Ballinger	4	November 6, 2020	Fun game, but I never got my reward for pre-registration as I've been waiting for this to come out
Rony Binu	1	November 6, 2020	Want it offline 😔
Asmit Deshwal	5	November 6, 2020	Must give more free stuff yaa that necessary and don't increase the price so high it's for kids please 🙂
Ahnaf Tajwar	3	November 6, 2020	+ Better combo detection + Better graphics + Rewards grindable with score + Fun mini games (doesn't get boring easily) + Many things to do - Constant net connection needed (disconnection = lost progress, even after reconnecting) - Paid players get direct advantage in PvP - Very long seasons - Gambling in a game that children play (children are more susceptible to being addicted and wasting money) - Season pass cost isn't region-based (costs more than thrice the COD mobile battle pass here!!!)
Aditya Iswandi	5	November 6, 2020	"Fruit Ninja games are awesome!!! I enjoy playing Fruit Ninja since 10 years ago. But I can't log in to my google play account in this game (Fruit Ninja 2). It says ""Link error '3', please try again later or contact Support if this problem persist."""

Alexantvor Gorviktr	2	November 6, 2020	I pre-registered to this game because I saw it has a really cool tiger character in the pre-registration images... Nope, he's not in the game upon release... Maybe I'll give it another chance if he's actually in the game... But I'll give it 2 stars for now...
Zhong Sheng Lee	3	November 6, 2020	same gameplay with making former cosmetics into p2w mechanics. paid players have moves that makes the fruits gather to a single straight swipe and the games mocks at how f2p you are when after the match they let you compair how weak your free blade is.
Jake Ashman	1	November 6, 2020	Won't load my cloud save keeps starting me at level one I spent money and lots of time... fix it

Kim Jillian Hinampas	3	November 7, 2020	Its a great a app but then when i played ,it says it can't save my progress because of unstable network, then i check if my network is really unstable but it's not.Is it my phone? I have fun playing though 😁
Robert Robillard	5	November 7, 2020	It's ARRIVED !! and I couldn't be more Happier !! HalfBrick has Delivered as Promised & I have to say, that I am a BIG Fan of the Original Fruit Ninja & now that Fruit Ninja 2 is Here, more Gameplay for me is inStore. The Game, is AWESOME! Great Graphics, Sound & GamePlay, NO Lagging whatsoever! a PERFECT Sequel to the Original There are MANY CopyCats on GOOGLE Play .. that don't Match up to the Original .. IF, you want a True & FUN experience, Look NO Further than HalfBrick & their EVER Popular Fruit Ninja 1 & 2 Thankyou, to ALL Involved, The Wait was well Worth it! Regards, :)
Tyrel Joseph	5	November 7, 2020	Never installed any faster in my life. The combo system is a lot more lenient Which is so satisfying and everything overall is just amazing. No blade power description, but it's in beta. I understand. The Arcade mobile game legend shall rise again!
Sid & Garima.	5	November 7, 2020	Just love the game ❤️ the graphics are so cool way better than FRUIT NINJA. HALFBRICK your games are just awesome. Keep it up and make more games like this. You deserve 5.0★. Thanks HALFBRICK so much. #thebestgame#halfbrick is better than anything
Vlada Stojanovic	5	November 7, 2020	I like it. Looks good and so far works great

Jeri Haapavuo	3	November 7, 2020	Ten years ago the game was a cool tech demo. Now it has aged and the mechanics are only decent but not enough to get me hooked. Played 3 games and then uninstalled.

Roshan Sai	5	November 7, 2020	Felling so happy that fruit ninja is back with something new and spicy#Letsgetfruity
Alexis García	3	November 7, 2020	I'm glad they released a new game, and even more fun. But, it has some bugs, sometimes the game crashes and the combos are a little slow. It's irrefutable this isn't a 2.0 version, I would say it's still beta version
Theresa Fyffe	5	November 7, 2020	Fun, frustrating at times when I get hit by mom
ThuyLinh Vu	1	November 7, 2020	It shows if you pre-register, you'll receive 1000 play points. I pre-register and have just installed the app so where is my 1000 play points?
Krish Gupta	5	November 7, 2020	This game is fantastic 🥰🥰🥰
Phan Đăng Nhật Minh	1	November 7, 2020	In the competitive events (Point Race and Mystery Powerups), I got progress reset maybe five times already. Once I almost played one hundred ganes in one event and then got reset.

Kaposa Bwale	4	November 8, 2020	Loving the game so far 😁 but I don't like the fact that is 100% online 😭 that is why I give 4 stars otherwise it's a great game can't wait to what new things are going to be added to the game 😎😎
Zuwara King	3	November 8, 2020	Why can u not play the game offline? This game is great and a pvp mode is awsome and all but not being able open the app or play anything in it while offline is big down for me 2.5 stars
George Campbell	3	November 8, 2020	Going the way of all popular games (SEASON PASS)
Imperius USMC	4	November 8, 2020	Excellent upgrade from the first. Different modes are fun. But I will ask that you remove the option to leave a VS match. People get salty and leave before completion, robbing me of my rating.
games place 2.7	5	November 8, 2020	This is what you're waiting for this the best game
ARTYOM MALITSKY	1	November 8, 2020	I search up CHEAP GAMES and apparently this is cheap and then it takes up 20976795 MB

jonathan weatherly	1	November 8, 2020	Its dumb
SteveTheMojang [GD]	4	November 8, 2020	I love this game, so smooth game experience but the battery is more consumed to use it, they didn't backup properly needs to restart first to backup the game, they freeze in the middle while I playing, using powerups is too difficult try to make a little video tutorial in help as more better using it, also in League mode it's better to add an Rematch button if he/she like an rematch, that's for all, THANKS!
NooB BoT	4	November 8, 2020	Nice game
Shihab Shahriar	2	November 8, 2020	Good job

Shivraj Singh Kushwah	5	November 8, 2020	The game is amazing... But there is a suggestion. After pause when we resume again play 3 seconds so that we have time to prepare...
Morne Muller	1	November 8, 2020	Have to reconnect after ever game and almost have to play ever mini games twice before it saves progress
Quora Dunbar	1	November 8, 2020	I clicked the app many times and it didn't even load all the way. It was the same loading screen for 20 mins. I timed it before the app crashed. I restarted my phone, connected to wifi AND data, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, AND closed all the other apps I had open. It won't go further from the loading screen. This has happened 8 times so far. All I see is the Halfbrick logo and sound, and then the loading screen pops up. And stays that way frozen for about 15 to 20 mins before crashing.

GT JSN	5	November 8, 2020	Amazing
bader 3ADE	5	November 8, 2020	It's great with no ads
gaming with shafi	5	November 8, 2020	I have playing fruit Ninja your first game I played this game so much like five years
The Maniac Core	1	November 8, 2020	Just a quick money grab. The ranked modes are unbalanced, and you'll often find yourself in unbeatable matches. Everything is locked behind microtransactions, and there's only so much you can do to slowly inch towards getting something half decent. I wouldn't bother with this unless you're willing to shell out $9.99 for a Battle Pass on a game that absolutely shouldn't have one.
Wesley Trust	1	November 8, 2020	Wasn't able to play, every time I open it hangs on step 11 of 12.
Fransisco LeGarda	2	November 8, 2020	SAYS IT CANT SAVE BECAUSE OF CONNECTION ISSUES I AM CONNECTED TO MY XFINITY WIFI I DONT UNDERSTAND !!
Neko Singh	5	November 8, 2020	I played on my bros phone and I loved it and so did he we like to play the league it is a fun and addictive game I love it 5 star
sunil rauniyar	1	November 8, 2020	Idk, i didnot like bcz of same concept i think it should be little a real player who cut the fruit sort of thing it has change little bit animation but where is a story line..i didnot like the game due to the same concept there is only animation differ from fruit ninja..but if you can develop multi competing or voice chat like with random it would be fun ..
Nathaniel Blackburn	4	November 8, 2020	A clear improvement over the original but can't help but feel while I like the idea of a season pass (better than subscriptions), £10 is a lot for a game with not a huge amount of depth.
Stew V	2	November 9, 2020	No point the game is good but u can only play on one till the timer runs out on others so u end up playing the same events over and over
Devil Killer	3	November 9, 2020	Loads of glitches and too hard to rank up in battle pass is good but alot of bugs in ticket games
Harry Bishop	2	November 9, 2020	Good but the shuffle event is so buggy its virtually impossible to pass, keeps crashjng, randomly removing lives, not counting level completions and making me redo levels over and over.
Srp Thesneaky	1	November 9, 2020	This game has so many bugs with the events, one time it didnt show me the hearts going down. Half of the time you win an event it either doesnt count, or once it even said it counted as a normal arcade game. It is so stupid
PS Sangha	5	November 9, 2020	Love It! Spent loads of time playing the first years ago and some great memories...
Dhanush raju	1	November 9, 2020	this is pay to win , micro transaction loaded like previous one ! hated and blacklisted.
NullFoam11	2	November 9, 2020	This game is Shadow Fight 3 for poor
LEGO City Live Stream PS4 And PS5	5	November 9, 2020	Wow
Isaac Betancourt	1	November 9, 2020	I think you don't understand that one of the things that made fruit ninja amazing was the possibility to play it anytime, anywhere without having to worry about the wifi. Why is it you decided to destroy one of your most popular franchises? Disappointed. Uninstalled.
Kabelo Rants'eli	5	November 9, 2020	I love it

Clifford Youn	2	November 9, 2020	Can not play even a single game without any internet connection.
Patrick Meng	2	November 9, 2020	"Fairly fun, but so many things are still broken. Especially your servers, if it ""can't connect"" it's an automatic loss of items, even upon victory. If you want every item to be verified, then buy more server space. Otherwise, make it verify less often and give players the benefit of the doubt rather than punish players because your servers don't work. Oh, and I paid for an item on the assumption that it removes ads. I still get the occasional 5 second interstitial ad, which is unacceptable."
Boom Katz	2	November 9, 2020	first one was better
Areanah Irish	5	November 9, 2020	Best game I have played and I've been waiting por a second one I have also played the other one since I was five ✨🤡❤️
Angeltonio	1	November 9, 2020	Se requiere internet constantemente para jugarse, de hecho al cargarlo la primera vez me da error..para conectarse a los servidores..
Ali syed	5	November 9, 2020	One of the best juiciest game ever..
John M	3	November 9, 2020	Seems to me pretty much the same as the original Fruit Ninja. That was a great game, but I played it so much that this game seems boring right away.
Malay N	1	November 9, 2020	Last update, Mini Game Shuffle Keep shuffling forever without locking it after spending ticket. Tooo many Animations slowing game down between menus. Now Intrusive high volume ads popup randomly, annoying. Made it bad.
L White	4	November 9, 2020	More events then I like. But good game app

torikaze	5	November 9, 2020	Game of the year
Pravallika Achanta	1	November 10, 2020	Too laggy as it connects to server each step That's quite unstable, like we play game and if connection error everything will go waste (obvious we are wasting time in game) and restart and play again(they lose nothing just they get new feature to get us hanged in game longer by replaying same levels ...didn't expect such lagness from fruit Ninja...
Victor QuyUy	4	November 10, 2020	Not many new things. 120hz out of the box is a nice one
StarscourgeJester	2	November 10, 2020	There's micro-payments which is nothing new for mobile games, however, there's also lootcrates, a shard system and in game ads (double ads as well) Play the original fruit ninja, there's nothing substantially different or new between the two.
M Reza	3	November 10, 2020	Offline support please .... Just like the first game
Jeremiah Passafume	3	November 10, 2020	Game lags here and there and does not save some matches on mystery shuffle.

samardeep Singh	5	November 11, 2020	Good ge this so good experince
Ken S	1	November 11, 2020	Never gets past the loading screen.
Luís Guilherme Agostinho Rodrigues	3	November 11, 2020	It's a fun game, but the Minigame Shuffle has a lot of problems. It's crashing a lot, and I'm losing progress and tickets. Also it's not clear what I get with the Season Pass, and if it's a monthly payment or a one time only. And sometimes the blade just don't cut, specially against other users.
Madara Uchiha	5	November 11, 2020	Its really good. Gives the good arcade feeling of game we all know and love. Truly a classic in mobile gaming history
Sina Maihami	1	November 11, 2020	Why there is no friend list and the custom room is a total mess it doesnt work at all
E Fox	4	November 11, 2020	"It's a good game that got me back into Fruit Ninja after a decade, with great graphics, albeit the extra animations after ending a game get insanely obnoxious. It started out fine but today I'm having tons of bugs. New high score didn't save, leaderboard freezes levels, I've upgraded blades 4 times in last 24hrs but NONE of the upgrades are taking. There needs to be more consistent games in ""Events"" section. Keep classic & zen mode 24/7. In some games it's obvious you're set up to fail. Fix bugs"
Ree Lord	1	November 11, 2020	Only downloaded the game for the free 1000 play points promotion but never got it company scammed people to get alot of early exposure sad that your game alone cant bring players......(will give honest review and feedback of game if they fix pre registration problem)

Komal Satashankar	1	November 11, 2020	It stops after it goes to 11 loading so i haven't even played this game because of it stop's
Muhammad Shafiq Abdul Shukor	1	November 11, 2020	The game progression is very slow. The coin/gold is hard to get, even if you ranked high enough, you still need to wait 90 days for seasons to end so that you can get your gold. The power is gold dependent to upgrade. So you can only upgrade if you eait for weeks or even month to get enough gold. This game reeks pay to win because while you can't get your gold, other player that bought the in-game currency will slaughter you in pvp. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME.
OGEN Tube	4	November 11, 2020	I loved this game, but I have a problem when I play online I can't cut fruits;Please solve this problem and thank you for your previous reply😘
Ryan Gosselin	3	November 11, 2020	I like the game but the cheating bots are extremely obvious. Also some of the powerups need some balancing, like big fruits.
Travis Pack	1	November 11, 2020	I recently completed the minigame mix up event with a score of 2700ish. I opened the watermelon box i was rewarded, after doing so the event ended and i could not collectthe 1000 coin prize. Will give 5 stars after being contacted with solution.
Manthan Upadhyay	1	November 11, 2020	Worst game i am very unsatisfied, I loged in from a different device then my account just vanished, very unsatisfied nothing to say
Abdul Munim Altaf	4	November 11, 2020	It is amazing than the last version. It feels so realistic. I advise you whoever is reading this you have got to try this. It is easier to get the swords and characters. I have just started to play and i love it. I highly recommend this game.🗡️🍉🍊🍌🍍🍌🍓🍒🍏. Just one thing, that it connects to the internet alot, it should connect only once at the start, once only. And it should have the ability to work in both online and offline.
Victor Majumder	5	November 11, 2020	I am starting to like this game again like the older one. However, the old fruit ninja game started to make some problems. Love both of these game.
Anna Marie Garcia Reyes	2	November 11, 2020	Laggy,so laggy!Why?It make my phone big lag because of this game.But the game is cool.
Jamon Macaraeg	1	November 11, 2020	Why does it had online its a single player game why do you to be online just to play this game:halfbrick studios if you guys are reading this please make the game offline.PLEEEEEEAAAAASSSSEEE!!!!!
Gabriele Valsecchi	1	November 11, 2020	such an unstable game, full of bugs and hackers. events are impossible to play, because the session crashes every 5 minutes and make me lose the game multiple times. my expectations were much higher and it actually looks exactly like the previous one
Abid Ali	5	November 12, 2020	XxxxCB 456764
ale rabbit	3	November 12, 2020	Decepcionado com o sistema de níveis . Perdi muitos convites no evento por conta de bugs.
Dorian Boussakine	3	November 12, 2020	5 stars if more freedom on playing modes
suzana Pende	5	November 12, 2020	Almost every time when I get comercial everything freezes and then I need to get out of the game
Nicholas Wong	1	November 12, 2020	Fun game. Classic and Arcade mode is buggy. When I hit a bomb or when the attempt is finished and I get game over, the game does not load the exp earned screen and stays in the Classic/Arcade mode screen. I have to quit the session to exit Classic/Arcade mode, but I don't get the points I earned for that run. Fix this ASAP. This is unacceptable.
Arshad Khan	5	November 12, 2020	Good games
TheUltimateOgrelord 27	1	November 12, 2020	No offline mode
Gavin Hubbard	5	November 12, 2020	Its asome peaple like the first one so th3 second one i asome

Android 17	1	November 12, 2020	Trash!! Stupid Non skippable Ads!! There is no option to even pay to get rid of these!
Liam Mott	1	November 12, 2020	Crashes all the time and freezes
Shivanarayana 4a	3	November 12, 2020	Good
Travis Mendez	2	November 13, 2020	Game is very glitchy as far as receiving items correctly. I recieved blade shards from a plant that took 4hrs. I go to upgrade said blade, and no shards. I was trying to upgrade blades that had enough and I had more than enough gold and wouldnt upgraded. Seems like a half developed game that shouldnt have left beta until it was completed.
Joshua Salisbury	1	November 13, 2020	Does not work
Sharp Coyote	3	November 13, 2020	Crashes every 5 rounds. Otherwise amazing game!
RD BLOCKS	5	November 13, 2020	Very nice game😚😚😚
Jamie D'Ath	1	November 13, 2020	Edit: got a new phone, and can't transfer the data via Google play. Just sends me back to the beginning, so I'm just going to abandon the app The wifi/internet issues are pretty poor. It keeps erroring my progress needing me to replay stuff, and stuff I've earned from the garden just disappeared. Also on mini have mode, it'll randomly knock a heart off when I haven't failed anything, it's super annoying
costas achilleos	2	November 13, 2020	So they basically realised they had an awesome game and brought to the billiond dollar pie so they can have a slice. The gameplay is the same the engine seems the same so another low cost project to make a ton of money. Can't fault nostalgia and solid gameplay
Mohammad B	1	November 13, 2020	Would make ur hand and ur fingers so tired ufffffffff
Mizanur Rahaman Azhari	5	November 13, 2020	Wow
Abhisek Anand	1	November 13, 2020	Lots of connection issues, game progress doesn't get saved and at times i cannot even start the game as it keeps giving connection errors. The original fruit ninja game works just fine. Uninstalling this one.
Atharva Durgavale	5	November 13, 2020	Nice.
Lewsmoken Weed	5	November 13, 2020	Like so muck
Mohamed Gamal	2	November 13, 2020	Why i can't make it full screen and take full screen even with the camera hole space like the old version 😔

Diane Ortiz	1	November 14, 2020	Hello Halfbrick developer. I paid $2.99 for a package (to unlock bed seeds), my account was charged and I didn't get my purchased. I enjoy playing this game and hope you reimburse me or grant me my purchase. I have the receipt. Please advise how to claim.
Shawn Amaefula	2	November 14, 2020	This was taking too long to start the game. Well I didn't mean that. But there's a bug in the game, and it always acts weird when I try to enter my nickname. I just uninstalled the game. Pls fix it and I'll reinstall the game.

it's Justena	5	November 14, 2020	This game it let out anger for me I know the rankings are hard but it lets out my anger when I'm angry I play this game and I slice everything so for those people who's giving it one rate because they're new to the game no offense the girl says take 90 days no way you must have the wrong fruit ninja 2 I'm sorry but it's the truth
Marc 83	4	November 14, 2020	Overall a very fun game! I would prefer this one more than the original ( cough cough loot boxes ). But levelong up is a little too easy, I legit grinded for 2 hours straight and got to level 14. That's how easy leveling up is.
Mohit Vanderwala	3	November 14, 2020	Control your adds half brick studios after every round an annoying add comes and why didn't you make it offline like others it has too much connectivity problem internet problem what are developers doing give some nice update to fix this problems or may unistall it

Sarah Waller	2	November 6, 2020	"Whenever you would try to do anything good for citizens, you would get ""busted"" yeah, I just got busted for giving someone their money, and then instead of stealing a hotdog I waited to buy it... So illigal"
Luqman Hakim	1	November 6, 2020	This game too many ad and not evan logic

Empress Nylani	1	November 6, 2020	"Played until lvl.73. Game loops itself into a restart ine you move your house, after cult mission. The ads are the same like any other ""free"" game so, I would say, that complaint is invalid. It definitely needs to be revised."
Jack Type	2	November 6, 2020	Great game good story line but it really slows down your phone and there is way too many ads there is and ad after every right guess or decision that you make

Justin Patten	2	November 7, 2020	Games fun, but my only complaint is that is freezes whenever I try to watch adds when I unlock new clothes or to watch an add for more cash. Thats just bad design.
Pragya Baral	1	November 7, 2020	From my view , this game encourage childrens to steal from others . And Ads sucks...
Nick Starns	1	November 7, 2020	Ad filled game, if they cut down on the ads it'd be a lot more enjoyable and probably would get a solid 3 stars

LaDonna Williamson	5	November 8, 2020	This is an awesome game but if it has too many ads turn off the internet
Lydia Turner	3	November 8, 2020	Was fun but appears to have started over ??
Hinged Phoenix44	1	November 8, 2020	It has to many as and you have a place to level up and it means nothing, and game is boring where you can't choose what to do out of 2 choices or else fail if choose wrong one, when it should continue after you choose that choice.

bring back Xboxaddictionz	2	November 11, 2020	The ads are annoying, and you pretty much have to watch them, and I'm willing to make that sacrifice, but I can't because whenever I press rewind it just freezes.

Zero Eight	1	November 11, 2020	Random outcomes to crappy choices which all end up with an ad. Awesome. It's pure guess work.
Becky Burch	3	November 11, 2020	It was worth 5 stars until I reached level 51 where everything I did started over and I had to do the same thing over again with the same answers and then did the same thing at level 101! No one wants to repeat the same actions in a game every 50 levels! Not worth downloading or if you do delete after you have to start over at level 51! In my opinion the devs need to add more different things and choices to the game or stop scamming people 4.99 to get rid of ads if you repeat stuff.
Ramu Bhusal	3	November 11, 2020	Played upto level 75. Same levels after 50. Repeated...

Christian Garay	1	November 13, 2020	The game keeps rewinding when you get to a high level
Mohammed Yasin	1	November 13, 2020	Worst game i have ever played.... Please remove it from playstore
Kristin Cruz	2	November 13, 2020	Its funny but basically, you are rewarded for making bad choices. The story line does not flow- jumps around, the further you go, the worse the attempted use of English gets. :-( You need clear proper English to know what is being asked of you. It needs work. After each question, theres an ad.
Puteri Noorsyakira	5	November 13, 2020	Cool
Echo and the crewmate!	4	November 13, 2020	It was really an experience, I'd for sure play it again.
Someone who everyone hates	1	November 13, 2020	So many ads..The ads are so bad that I can't even enjoy the game..You get abused for literally doing the right thing, Which I find stupid, Because you're basically making homeless people look bad..Even though not all of them are bad. I do not recommend playing, Numerous ads, And this game just isn't fun.
Harry gaming	1	November 13, 2020	It's so boring
AM DAT	3	November 13, 2020	What did they think to make this game
BRIAN Sudi	5	November 13, 2020	Wow
Haru chandes	2	November 13, 2020	This game was just randomly weird. All the choices are so absurd like when I think of a poor man vs a gangster, the gangster would win but no in this game almost all the choices I wanted to make went the opposite way. I mean the game was fine just it was annoying to repeat the level cuz of that one mistake. Furthermore, the story 75% of the time doesn't even seem to make sense. It's like making me think twice about how common sense works I just cannot.
Banjo Isis	5	November 13, 2020	Good
ICU Rodriduez	5	November 13, 2020	Good game this is weird and funny and the thing is that was dum btw that u just got homeless into rich I mean that's a good game btw

Sayeeda Waiza	1	November 14, 2020	Nah!
Wang Teng Tan	1	November 14, 2020	What the heck?! In this game, you spent so much time watching the ads, and not only that, the game loops itself. You become a beggar right after you became rich! What logic is it to host a big celebration for the opening of your brand new project and all of a sudden get thrown out of a window? It disappoints me so much.
Tiger_vii	2	November 14, 2020	Lion studios at it's finest...... Ads ads ads ads ads ads ads ads, some are optional, but after every senario your forced to watch an ad for a few seconds before u can skip.... Love the game concept...hate the watch ads to win gameplay...... Its name is wrong, street hustle.....should be ADS HUSTLE

Terry Ingram	5	November 7, 2020	The only problem is being asked to review less than 2 minutes into opening the app I hadn't even had a chance to do anything and it asked me and then 30 seconds later it asked me again and it kept asking me and kept asking me so you got to change that that's not a good thing but every time the balls drop you get a good amount and it's going up really quick which makes me believe that this is a fake game cuz all the ones that I've tried to do that are fake but we'll see

Keba Sanders	1	November 10, 2020	0stars rules upon cashout😤 fake, false, misleading ads What are the consequences of false advertising? If your company is caught advertising falsely, you could end up losing a lot of money. If you are forced to pull your ad, you will lose all of the money that you spent developing that ad. You may also be charged a fine by the FTC

Kevin Dean	1	November 11, 2020	This app is designed for the developer to make money off of you watching adds. When you near your pay out goal, your progress will be halted indefinitely. By the time you've gotten that far, you will have already watched hundreds of ads. Developer makes money off of the dangled carrot of a false promise.

Monica McCombs	2	November 12, 2020	Been playing a few days. Got up to $90 cash.. completed the daily task for the extra $5. After that i went from $95 down to $93. Down to $91 within a few minutes of getting that extra $5. Wonder why they keep deducting the money amount. Strange.

Karrie jackson	4	November 12, 2020	Now I would have given this game 5 stars because it is a fun game. But it has taken me all the way up to 99/100 to win an amizon $100 gift card and 49/50 to win an I pbone and on bith of the minion things Im only 1 away from winning those gift cards and as for actual cash I have $96.17 but it has a pop up that will pop up during play and makes you hit $2 to get more ball and has done this 4 times to me when Im like $1.50 away from winning $100. Now it stopped giving amything.
Achille Davidson	4	November 12, 2020	My only experience is when it comes to collecting from the Ads it doesn't matter what levels you've reach it block you from collecting the paypal payout I think that is stealing and cheating the players out of the paypal payout....

Ashley Manning	1	November 12, 2020	False advertisement the advertisement actually States that you can get your money before you hit a 100 which is false You have to hit a 100 to receive money If I knew how to report it to the police I would it's false advertisement which is illegal in the United States
Faye Sager	5	November 12, 2020	Fun
Fatima Melander	5	November 12, 2020	It's fun. You win money too.
Kristen Klem	5	November 12, 2020	Lots of fun to tap I just hope there is actually a payout at the end 🤷🏻‍♀️
Ritta Olson	1	November 12, 2020	This game is fun but a rip-off. So far it has taken $6 from my cash total. Since when does a player need to pay for a free game? I reach some over 92 dollars and POUF! another 2 dollars gone! Well, I am deleting this app. It just took another $2.
Robert Palumbo	1	November 12, 2020	I got to almost $100 then they update and raise the cash out to $150. When I got close to 140 no more money coins. I can't say I am surprised. I am stuck on 49 puzzle pieces only needing one more and 99 amazon pieces again only needing 1 more. All these games are scams. I got the last doll but it would not let me collect it. What a joke.You can earn money but never enough to cash in. Waste of time. Don't download if you expect to earn money.

Steve Dialisis666	5	November 12, 2020	I've finally found a game that is entertaining as well as profitable. There are too many games which are a waste of time being you are only given a few cents for an hour or more of my time. I may as well pay them for the time I spend on a game which is not even close to getting me to want to continue playing for the purpose it was created for, an that is to fill my leisure time doing something which is fun an enjoyable with the added feature.........,$$$$$$$$!!! Thank you.

Philanopolis Golderlair	5	November 13, 2020	Once you know to just drop the balls by hitting the bottom slot, it's pretty good.
J thomas	2	November 13, 2020	I just hope i get my money and if so then i give it 5 stars
Connie Lusher	3	November 13, 2020	I am changing my first rating of this game. At first I liked it but the longer you play the more ads pop up. Your lucky to be able to tap to drop balls 3 or4 times before the next ad pops up. Then once it goes to an ad it sits there buffering trying to load. Then after the ad finishes the game freezes and all you can do is exit and start over again. Can the developer try to address these issues?
Joy Basoc IturraLde	5	November 13, 2020	Grèat

Isaias Sanchez	1	November 13, 2020	SCAM! i'm missing 1 phone puzzle piece, 1 animal figure, 1 monster figure, and 1 Amazon card from winning. All the sudden i get close and it stop giving me prizes. Also it stopped giving me money balls after reaching $97.23. Total scam. Not gonna try and get 3Million points because it might just stop giving me balls by then. You can never win, this game is false and a scam.

Rachel Hunter	1	November 13, 2020	Like everyone else I've got to $96.68 and no longer getting green balls. Yet another game that says they're different and you'll win, yet let's you down. People install these games in good faith and developers just con people with promises. People should report these games to trading standards.
Kelly Snyder	5	November 13, 2020	Out of this world and very fast game

Iccees Strahan	1	November 13, 2020	If i could give it ZERO stars i would. This game does not payout just like the rest. I have been ONE AWAY from all the prizes for the last month and I still have not gotten any progress. The payout amount is $150 and i have been sitting between $139 -142 for weeks now and money just disappears for no reason. THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF TIME!

Sandy Brendley	5	November 14, 2020	Challenging to watch all the balls drop LOL
Jacob Mitchell	5	November 14, 2020	Very addictive
Emily Wallace	5	November 14, 2020	Nice game just started playing seems to be ok waiting to see if i can cash out
Tony Tuttle	5	November 14, 2020	It is a alright game
Jennifer Olavydez	1	November 14, 2020	I've been playing this game for a week and I got stuck to $94.20 for a few days now. Waste of time!
Emily Mast	5	November 14, 2020	great game
Raynell Naper	5	November 14, 2020	Awesome playing fun and cash
KATHLEEN Gault	1	November 14, 2020	This is illegal and false advertising. I am contacting a lawyer. Guaranteeing money to people that can never be redeemed. I feel a big pay day coming my way!
MeltedBarley358	4	November 14, 2020	I don't know if it give money but it is fun, not as many ads as the other games
Leo Ham	5	November 14, 2020	So far ok
Tammy Graves	5	November 14, 2020	Dose it pay out if so you Desirve 5*
Avi Elkaim	2	October 15, 2020	Good game, way too many ads.
ItzDoleful	1	October 16, 2020	Same images over and over again
Cesar Martinez	1	October 16, 2020	Too many ads
Aishlyn Manning	4	October 16, 2020	I like the game it's just there is only like 5 levels and I would like more. Otherwise I love it and recommend it.
Destructo	1	October 16, 2020	Too many ads.
Scott Sherwood	1	October 18, 2020	Only like 5 levels
Jackie	1	October 18, 2020	Only like 10 shirt prints and then it repeats.
Leah Martin	1	October 19, 2020	I liked the concept of the game, but there was no way to turn off the vibration. Which really annoyed me because I kept thinking that someone was trying to contact me. Also the game killed my battery I had my highest battery saver on and I was at 25% and within 3 minutes of playing the game with no other apps open it was at 10%.
D Davis	1	October 19, 2020	Has 10 levels tops and you get an ad between every level. If you had way more levels and make less ads it might be worth another download until then it will be Uninstalled
John c	2	October 20, 2020	I need more designs and less ads. I was done with the app after about 10 minutes.
Maria Boyington	1	October 20, 2020	There are only 6 levels then it just repeats its self. If they where different and got harder it would be fine. But other then that it's okay
mando viking	1	October 20, 2020	Extremely lazy only 10 shirts then it repeats
XX_SADBOYZ_XX	1	October 21, 2020	Same shirt and designs
Joseph Shelton	1	October 22, 2020	Ads after every play. You do a shirt and you get a commercial. Do another and you get another commercial. It doesn't do a few games then commercial. It's commercials nonstop.
Emylie Sue	1	October 23, 2020	Lag
Drew Cockerham	1	October 23, 2020	Interesting idea, but you're forced to watch an ad after every level.
Kody Sorum	1	October 23, 2020	So many ads.... Not worth trying to play.
Cole Curry	1	October 24, 2020	There's like less than 15 levels then it just starts over again. Don't waist your time
linsey williamson	1	October 24, 2020	Don't work
Gary Williams	1	October 24, 2020	Its just an ad not a game.
KingPenguin 4301	1	October 24, 2020	Very poor. The gameplay is extremely easy and boring, and there is an ad after every level.
Michelle Funk	2	October 25, 2020	I downloaded it because it sounded fun and it was except i couldnt turn off the vibrate feature
Kevin	1	October 25, 2020	There is one actual challenging level and the rest are just filler
Zachary Floyd	1	October 26, 2020	Literally an ad after every paint
Nicolas McIntyre	1	October 27, 2020	Boring
Dessert Rabbit YT Gaming	1	October 27, 2020	Too many ads. Ad then level ad then level ad
Emily Ellison	1	October 28, 2020	Waaaaay too many ads and honestly just very easy
Lucy Dragneel	1	October 28, 2020	Ad after ad after ad
Tristan T	1	October 29, 2020	Sucks overloaded with adds
Ashlee Rose	1	October 29, 2020	Everytime i download and try to play it freezes my whole phone and wont work.
Jak Cooper the Lombax	1	October 30, 2020	Low frame rate even when I had my phone set to give me high frames and no option to turn off vibrations which just grew painful for me to hold in my hands. I'd give 0 stars if I could.
Noah Lopez	1	October 30, 2020	Just A money grab with too much ads
Sibby's World	5	October 31, 2020	👌
Allysia Danielle	5	November 1, 2020	I actually like this game a lot more than I thought i would!
Rainbow Twinz	5	November 1, 2020	Its very fun
Tim Harris	5	November 1, 2020	It fun
Souffle Fillet	1	November 1, 2020	5 seconds into the game and an unskippable 30 second ad. Nope.
Roy L	1	November 2, 2020	Can't complete more than two levels without ads interfering. Fun game but the constant ads ruin it. Save yourself the download.
Alan Bowen	5	November 2, 2020	Cool
Davis Callaway	1	November 2, 2020	Too easy
Missy Harris	5	November 2, 2020	The gaane is great but you cant turn the vibration off

sam B	5	November 2, 2020	It's really fun and challenging
Ryder Hefferan	1	November 3, 2020	Nearly unplayable with the sheer amount of ads shoved down your throat. The gamplay itself is boring and repetitive. This game sucks, don't download it.
Kayden Barnes	5	November 3, 2020	This game is so fun
Ninerfan 06	1	November 3, 2020	Game is trash is just 10 level and 24/7 ads and I don't get the point of making a game and this is useless like com'on
J. Carlos Gonzalez	1	November 3, 2020	The game is simple but the vibration drove me nuts. No settings to change that. I uninstalled the game.

Ruston Gilmore	1	November 4, 2020	Ads every level. Hard pass.
Nick Krings	5	November 4, 2020	Silkscreens for kids
Delena Anderson	3	November 4, 2020	It's a decent game. Very repetitive and occasionally reuses patterns. To all the people complaining about too many ads, turn on airplane-mode on your phone. I didn't get a single ad because of this. You're welcome.
Nikolas Hernandez	1	November 4, 2020	After every 1 or 2 jobs you have an ad. So great.
Darlene Durgan	4	November 4, 2020	Fun game yet it can be challenging. Wish there werent ads between every level.
Crista Wells	5	November 4, 2020	Awesome game
Sebastian Daza	1	November 5, 2020	Game doesn't work properly LOL

Kayla McMillan	1	November 6, 2020	I put 1 star because it doesn't do anything it is like it is frozen and there is too many ads try and fix this game. The amount of ads shoved down your throat is unbelievable if there was an average amount I might of recommend it but the game structure just suck by itself never mind you can barely play the game. I dont like this game you should fix it and if you don't there will never be this app on my phone ever again next time make and interesting game I don't recommend this game don't get it.

vibha mathur	3	November 6, 2020	1. You still get ads after offing wi - fi. 2. The levels are really hard. You won't belive, but the second level for me was itself so hard!! I managed to continue but still unhappy😢 UNINSTALLING Won't reccomend 👎😔 Thank you☺️☺️

*Queen Rocky*	1	November 7, 2020	AD EVERY TWO SECONDS
Brandon Green	1	November 7, 2020	Ads, ads, ads. And unlike other games that at least space them out after three or four levels, it does it after every one. Mind you, the levels doesnt last that long to begin with.

Jessica Peter	4	November 8, 2020	It's actually not bad for me because it is a very good idea for the people
Mohammad hashemi	5	November 8, 2020	پویان
The Bubba Master	2	November 8, 2020	I know it's not screen printing, but the trapping and layers are nothing like actual printing in most cases. Also... an Ad between EVERY SINGLE SHIRT?! Ridiculous.

Gether Washington	2	November 10, 2020	Game itself is alright, if you turn off data and wifi you dont get any ads, but you can't disable vibrations, and I like to save my phone's battery. If you ever fix this I'll install it again, but as-is, I'll keep away.

Leia Johnson	2	November 11, 2020	Way to many adds. After each completed puzzle! Just downloaded the game 25 minutes ago its 1:19am and Im on level 11 and each add is a different time from 10 seconds or less to 30 seconds. Its still a cool game painting shirts.
Ramesh Prajapati	5	November 11, 2020	Ramesh bahi

Sabita Naizi	5	November 11, 2020	Draw a line of?
John Teets	3	November 11, 2020	Fun enough, actually lives up to it's own ads, but also clogged with ads. After every shirt you make, an ad. Without those it'd be great. With them, it's not.
muhamed jamal	5	November 11, 2020	Wow i like it
Jade Marsh	5	November 11, 2020	Good game
Stephanie Ricketts	3	November 11, 2020	I think it's a cool game that has a bit of challenge here and there but I don't like that at the end of every round there's a add and there's no settings but other than that I think it's a really cool game!
Fred Asamoah	5	November 11, 2020	I like it
RoBo Snipez	2	November 11, 2020	I rate it a three becuase every level you complete you get an ad is annoying plus vibrations waste my battery on my phone when i play this game when my phone is on 100% i only have 30minutes becausof the vibrations
Ariyanna Strickland	5	November 11, 2020	This game is truly amazing!
Shameera Khan	5	November 11, 2020	Nice

Morgan mccormick	5	November 12, 2020	Goooooooooooooooooood
Lee Schilling	3	November 12, 2020	It's fun for a while but then the levels start repeating.
Max Price	1	November 12, 2020	This app sucks. I understand that some free apps put ads to make money and that's fine, but this app has waaaaay more ads then I thought. I exited out an ad and another one popped up. I'm uninstalling.
Fatima Abdelgadir	5	November 12, 2020	جميل
Cassandra Cyrus	4	November 12, 2020	Hurry up and load but I like this game even though I don't try it as yet
dany hirad	5	November 12, 2020	سلام من از امرز بعد جوز این بازی میتوانم بازی خیلی عالی حتما نصب کنید 🥰😊🙃
Heather Arbiter Vian	4	November 12, 2020	Actually starts off a little challenging. A lot of similar apps make you do stupid easy levels for way too long. Has ads but duh thats how the app makes money so the developers can eat.
acue Dennis	5	November 12, 2020	Excellent quality and fantastic quality
Vedanshi Shah	5	November 12, 2020	Excellent experience
Patrick Yee	4	November 12, 2020	Pretty relaxing and interesting. It's fun to think of how each image is created. The paint roller feature needs more functionality, you will notice that you have to use the handle and push it all the way, but it doesn't reset to ready position (not realistic). It would be cool if you could see the shirt on an avatar.
amirali hosseini	5	November 12, 2020	👍👍👍👍👍👌

David Glidden	1	November 12, 2020	Ad after every round? Yo....
Katie Ferris	2	November 12, 2020	The game itself would be relaxing if there wasn't an ad after every single level. Also there is no way to turn off the vibrations for the controls, which is annoying.
Dakota McClure	5	November 12, 2020	I just like it
Luis Ricardo	5	November 12, 2020	Tartar sauce
Brandon DeProw	1	November 12, 2020	Fun game but an ad after a 5 second level is a bit ridiculous.
Cassie	1	November 12, 2020	Too easy I did every puzzle within 2 hrs

fikri auditia	4	November 12, 2020	Funny.. But the ads 😑
Taylor Banta	2	November 12, 2020	Fun idea but there's tons of ads and it just repeats a handful of patterns over and over
Renzell Ortega	5	November 12, 2020	Good game
angela d	1	November 12, 2020	Way too many ads. You get one after every level
pleep ploop	3	November 12, 2020	Very fun and cute, but the inability to access options to turn off sound effects, and also the inability to look back at completed levels is frustrating and weird.
Nathan White	5	November 12, 2020	Absolutely amazing game i absolutely love it
Generation Dragon Production	5	November 12, 2020	It's a nice game to learn how to paint a shirt 😂
Harley Stout	5	November 12, 2020	Great job on the game.

Abou Samir	5	November 13, 2020	Is game so fun Wow
Didnt mean no harm	1	November 13, 2020	"Game is fine but the only reason I installed it was because I leave one star reviews on games that are like ""Only a genius can do this"" or ""I can't pass level one"". If it didn't have that ad I would've given it 2 stars."
Cody Medellin	5	November 13, 2020	This game is great for creative people it deserves a 10/10
Oneil Davis	3	November 13, 2020	Great game and all but the amount of puzzles are limited.. I've already gone over again about 2 times.. need more puzzles it got boring fast

Ruhollah Nakhaee	1	November 13, 2020	You will watch and and occasionally get to play.
Mir Cunningham	3	November 13, 2020	Vibration function needs to be able to be turned off. Too many ads
John Sheldon	1	November 13, 2020	While the game is okay, there is an ad after each and every level. EVERY LEVEL! I wouldn't take the time to download.
Kayla Kirby	1	November 13, 2020	The vibrations are annoying
Justin Tombs	4	November 13, 2020	Through the first dozen or so levels, the game is simple and a great time waste.

Chelsea Waller	1	November 13, 2020	Would love to have experienced the game but it kept freezing on me when i tried painting the first shirt so I guess I'll delete it

Laura Lily	2	November 13, 2020	This is a very fun app, but i absolutely cannot deal with the vibrating. I would love to carry on playing & rate this the 5 stars it deserves when there's an option to remove the vibrating, but for now I have to uninstall.

gary kinner	3	October 31, 2020	"A cute version on bingo. Payouts of 1 penny is ridiculous. Payouts should never be less than 10 cents. Shoul have different games. ""X"" or ""postage stamp"" and offer more payouts if u get that. Free phone u can get rid of. Put more into cash wins. Explanation of the rainbow balls would be nice."

Debra & Alton Vickers	3	November 1, 2020	The game is ok. I doubt its for real money. Too many ads tho. Don't let you just play bingo. Once you do you have to watch 2 to 3 videos. I might grow tired of this. Thats why I rated it a 3. It's saying I've won a lot of cash but seeing is believing. If you bore easy with a game that is always forcing you to watch videos then this is not the game for you either. But what do I know. You might like watching all those videos. I don't.

Patrick Wylie Deaton	5	November 2, 2020	The game has been very nice so far, unlike other game which would let you earn in big chunks at the beginning but would tend to limit the earning when you're getting closer to the minimim cashout. I will leave this at 5 stars unless I found that this game is not like the others.
Madonna Montales	1	November 2, 2020	the same scheme of fake money making games. at first it will give you excitement cause u winning big then when ur near the cash out amount, gradually the reward lessen until you wont receive any reward at all. fake.

marcelino yuan	5	November 5, 2020	So far i enjoy playing the game.....
안나Annekin78	3	November 6, 2020	The bingo game is actually fun! It's just funny because you put an iphone 11 for a prize but when you reach the 20th puzzle, it will stay there forever.😂 Just don't put prizes like that if it will just stuck there. And i'm experiencing a slow giving of coins and coin dollars when it reaches $90. So, i'm thinking this is not a real prize game. But the bingo game is nice though. So, i will still give 3 stars for the game. But just get real and remove all prizes if it isn't real.

joyce Sanchez	1	November 7, 2020	Yet another game that says you will get paid. But yet after $92.00 it gives less than 1¢ per money click. Another fake app through the unity company. And tons of ads on top of that. Unity never has games that you can cash out on. If it loads up saying unity at the beginning it's fake. The person that creates it and uses unity to scam others should go to jail. But since they are all chinese it'll never happen

Jesfer Coronel	5	November 11, 2020	lets play
ZomBigrl	2	November 11, 2020	The bingo itself is kinda fun but game tends to lock up when giving larger prizes. Twice now the ad showed a black screen instead of playing the ad after hitting the Amazon card, then it didn't pay out the card yet at the end of that game it showed i won a card. Phone gets hot while playing it within just a few games so I can never collect all the tasks for the day. I'm tired of fighting with it so I am uninstalling.
Frances Cansibog	5	November 11, 2020	Fun game
Gregory Erica Zynel	3	November 11, 2020	I actually LOVE this game as a whole. My only complaint so far is that occasionally when you win a bingo on a card, it will remain blacked out with bingo written on it so you can't continue playing on it. I've watched myself lose continual bingos due to this problem. Fix that and this game would be PERFECT!

Liz Hobbs	1	November 14, 2020	It becomes clear very quickly you will never reach the $100 threshold to withdraw money or prizes. I love bingo, and if this were at LEAST a decent bingo app, I would keep it, buts it's the worst bingo app I've ever played. If you plan to play it anyway, watch a video every time you're prompted. They're gonna play one anyway, you might as well make it worth the time
Rebecca Labaki	5	November 14, 2020	Great!!!

selah taylor	1	November 3, 2020	Play for 5 seconds, 30 seconds of ads.
Jane Clarke	5	November 4, 2020	Fun
Elizabeth Miller	1	November 4, 2020	Ads between each level? Too many. Uninstalled.
Jamie Miller	1	November 5, 2020	Spent more time watching ads than I did playing the first 3 levels. Terrible. Avoid.
SirOmega33	1	November 5, 2020	Lot of ads, puzzles are impossible to lose, so there's no actual challenge. All I'm doing is holding down a button for 6 seconds then watching an ad play for 30. How is this meant to be fun?
Nevy Dawn	2	November 5, 2020	I think there's a game in the ads
DurtyBurd84	1	November 5, 2020	This is literally an ad simulator, no joke, every time you touch the screen you get an ad, it's because the developers only get paid when people watch ads, so it's a money grabbing scam for the most part
Dan Browne	1	November 6, 2020	Good for two minutes then you get over the adverts.
Opal CS	1	November 6, 2020	Too many ads, no gameplay.
M Ph	2	November 6, 2020	To many ads are yall just doing this for money like d*nm
cindy fisk	4	November 6, 2020	Great pass the time fun
wolf ire	1	November 7, 2020	Boring with bad graphics
Christopher Brownawell	1	November 7, 2020	Not even one game in and I have to uninstall it!! I DIDN'T EVEN GET A TUTORIAL (though wouldn't have needed one anyway) it's no fun, the graphics are horrible, its super slow, I just finished a level and got an ad after pressing no. Please stop being jerks and reduce the amount of advertisements you put into your game/s
Heather Gartzke	5	November 7, 2020	Very challenging and enjoying
A Google user	4	November 7, 2020	Fun and simple
Owen Hopkins	1	November 7, 2020	All you do is hold down a button, and as soon as the container looks like it will be full the balls just slide past each other. So boring and there are so many ads.
Angie Glenn	3	November 7, 2020	Its a good idea but the execution is not the best the player doesn't seen to know the depth of the container so we can't be able to tell what will dissappear and what is going to saty thank is an issue I had seen earlier in the game
Baguette Yeeter	1	November 7, 2020	Way too easy and boring
Edward Hodgson	4	November 7, 2020	Amazing game! Barely any ads so fun and the only bad part is yhe levels are so easy👏👏
mrspence spence	1	November 7, 2020	the worst game I've ever played
Wolfie Buczkowski21	1	November 8, 2020	Lots of ads and the puzzle are really difficult it's it's not even fun it's a Scamp
snigdha satyajit	1	November 8, 2020	Worst
Phil Rosenberger	1	November 8, 2020	To many ads every round you have to watch an ad after.. uninstalled dont waste your time installing unless you like wasting your time
Winston Moore	5	November 8, 2020	A ok
Stephanie	1	November 8, 2020	Way, way, way too many ads. Only played it for 5 minutes and there were about 20 ads. Not worth the hassel, uninstalled.

Penny Fry	5	November 9, 2020	Fantastic game
Andrew Wilson	1	November 9, 2020	Ad's ad's ad's ad's ad's ad's
Daniel Neighbor	1	November 9, 2020	The ad showed the person failing at the lavel. They tried multiple ways and it wouldnt fit. I fell for the click bait. The levels are so easy and idiot could pass them in any order of the ball drop. I couldnt find a way to fail other than pushing the buttons too fast. Plus to top it off there is an ad after every level. Including the first level before I even got into it. With the level of ease and more ad watching then play time, I was over the game very quickly. Make it harder with less ads.
Ivan Lopez	1	November 9, 2020	This game is trash its too easy to fill up the container because the balls just overlap and they arent even close to filling up rhe container
Elaine J.	5	November 9, 2020	Cool game 👍

Darshil Mahraur	1	November 10, 2020	Wrost experience ... Lots of ad ... This is an advertising app not a game app
Cheyanne Weaver	1	November 10, 2020	I hate it this is just to watch ads and win all the time it is so boring I hated my experience and never download this again because it sucked and there was just too many ads and there was no way to lose like literally all you could do was win and it was so boring because I would like a challenge please fix this.

Cristy Nored	1	November 13, 2020	Ad simulator. You literally, cannot lose. No matter how you put the balls in, they compact together and you win. The purpose is only to get you to watch the ads.
phyrne doyle nelsen	4	November 13, 2020	Actually a bit of a challenge! Nice change from other games of this type. And the ads, while still longish and annoying, play between rounds and don't intrude on the game.
Brant Hooper	5	November 13, 2020	Love it...
Jason Riggs	5	November 13, 2020	Tons of fun!
Danny Mefford	5	November 13, 2020	Enjoyable
Kathy Becker	4	November 13, 2020	I see everyone has rated one star and complaining about the ads. Well- the ads are easy to bypass after 5 seconds and it's an easy game since I'm already on level 54. I'm soon done with it, but had fun.
the meeper	1	November 13, 2020	So...Where's the challenge? I closed my eyes and pressed the buttons randomly and still won

Rickey Cagle	1	November 14, 2020	This game sucks. You can't play it with out seeing a stupid commercial after every level whether you fail that level or not.

Lezelle Smith	5	November 13, 2020	Love this game
Danny Smith	2	November 13, 2020	enjoyed it. I will probabaly uninstall it though unfortunately because I have plenty of money but no flip coins I think its dumb that while renovating other peoples houses you have to use your own flip coins to unlock things, then use cash to pay for it. I would understand spending them to unlock items for our own house but not for side jobs. Wouldn't be so bad if there were daily flip coin rewards but this game is made to make you spend money. Thats messed up. Reward flip coins and ill keep it.
Tayler Yaguchi	5	November 13, 2020	Amazing. Other games would be so bad compared to this one, its like im almost playing the actual game on pc.

Felicia Thompson	5	November 13, 2020	Not bad
life is fun !!	5	November 13, 2020	I really love this game! Its a great time saver and theres so much to do! I do have a recommendation though, can you make it so that there isn't a time limit to get your money after you fix a house? If you cant do that, can you at least decrease the time so its not like 2 hours? If you guys could, it would be really nice! Thank you for making this fun game! I also have another recommendation, could you make it so that you dont have too spend so much gold coins for missions?
Robert Brill	5	November 13, 2020	Cool

Georgia Ford	5	November 13, 2020	Great
Ethan Bailey	4	November 13, 2020	Very fun, relaxing game that you can use to kill time. The bad thing though is it forces you to wait 4 hours before getting paid for a job. If they fix this and help out the free to play players, I will give them 5 instead of 4 stars.

Almin Kazić	5	November 13, 2020	Exellent game
Rebekah Dawson	5	November 13, 2020	Like the steam version but without having to do plumbing and wiring! Only down side is how long you would have to wait to receive payment for jobs if you don't have any special coins.
Jayden Davis	5	November 13, 2020	Good game

El Crossy	4	November 13, 2020	Its great for killing time and sometimes satisfying... Its annoying lossing the flip coins and not being able to watch an ad for more but to buy a bundle.
nightpenguin is a kool kid	5	November 13, 2020	I just am getting coins
Katie Budd	5	November 13, 2020	Best cleaning app features are realistic
Sarah Heaney	3	November 13, 2020	Fun game though I've reached a point where I've run out of gold coins and my choices are either pay for more (which I'm not going to do, the amount you get for $2 is not even enough for me to move forward in the game) or grind on one job (the 5k and 6k ones that are always there) repeatedly until I level up which still won't help me much. I don't like those options so I'll stick with the PC version of the game.
Lisa Natural Living	2	November 13, 2020	I loved this game to start with. One of the best house renovation games out there. The problem is repeating the same jobs over and over again to earn money and unlock coins. It was such a disappointment when I finished the big value jobs to come back and see the tutorial jobs again. Lost all interest now. Hoping that there are new jobs with the updates.
Thomas Peckham	4	November 13, 2020	Great little grinding game
Sakatashi	5	November 13, 2020	Surprisingly good for a mobile game. Obviously doesnt compare to the steam game HOWEVER this is awesome as a mobile alternative

Will Akins	4	November 13, 2020	It is fun to play when you have nothing else to do but not for all the time
Drago Drag	5	November 13, 2020	Reminds me of the steam game. Just wish I don't have to wait to get the money, especially 4 hours. Otherwise, I really like it
William Weber	3	November 13, 2020	Fun game for the mobile version, but you quickly get to the point where you constantly run out of the earned premium coins. Making this game pay to win within the first couple hours.
Octavia Jackson	3	November 13, 2020	Its more cleaning than remodeling
Lise Calderon	5	November 13, 2020	Very good game. It gives you something to do. Most games I download I always end up deleting them because I dont have a goal or something to do. It has good graphics and it gives you options.
the gamer1291	4	November 13, 2020	I find it fun

Raven Menethil	4	November 13, 2020	Good game. Wish to color the couch and stuff. Wish u can build up the coins quickly.
Lebron Howard	5	November 13, 2020	This is a awesome game 👍
Noah Baldiviezo	5	November 13, 2020	Pretty good for being free. Only catches are you have to wait 4 hours for cash from jobs, and you have to buy coins with real money to unlock more stuff to customize houses, and upgrade your equipment. However they give you enough gold coins to do stuff with it isn't in your face about buying coins to much. I will certainly give this game a couple bucks , because it is a good mobile game. Also I haven't gotten one ad playing this, and it has almost been a week
Rawitra Hikmal	5	November 13, 2020	Sometimes the control a bit to sensitive
KayBee Wooo	5	November 13, 2020	Yay

TerrificMisson323	3	November 13, 2020	amazing game. But please get rid of the gold coins. Please. I've stopped playing as much cause I cant afford stuff. Please just get rid of them they're so annoying to deal with. Also please have the install mechanism that the PC version has. I miss that. Other than that, great game!
Michelle Woods	5	November 13, 2020	well done! finally an actual design/flip sim without the match puzzles
Sam Benito	4	November 13, 2020	Way better than other home designer apps in that the animations are smooth and transitions fairly seamless. Would love to see some more of the Steam House Flipper options integrated here in future updates, like adding/removing walls and outside options. My main issue, and the reason this does not get 5 stars, is the REQUIRED use of premium currency to fulfil orders. I don't have an issue with using premium currency to unlock things to put in the houses we flip - that's a personal choice. However, to be forced to use my premium currency to complete a customer's order is ridiculous, especially since you don't earn any of it back when the order is completed. And the forced wait to earn the money after completing an order is also annoying - I'd be happy to watch an ad to speed things up, but it is an insult after you've spent time completing an order to then be forced to wait to receive the money you have earned. Far too many transactions that require premium currency, this needs to rebalanced.
Blue_ivy_wolf	5	November 13, 2020	Busy play
Maikee Bernos	5	November 13, 2020	It's fantastic! The graphics are great, its full of many designs and colors. I love how they focused on details like the paint on the wall stops midway if its out of paint in the roller. I just hope someday appliances and switches would be interactive.
Dominic Hale	4	November 13, 2020	It's a good game and everything but the wait for cash is retarded 🤪 I hope they can lower it pls

Torc Tarmin	3	November 13, 2020	Used to play the steam edition and while this is a good port to mobile, it is dissapointing that most everything in the renovation store must be purchased first with the premium in game currency, including items required to finish certain requests.

Salleh Ahmad	5	November 13, 2020	Imran busukasam ngeauto spam
Zoey	2	November 13, 2020	After the first few jobs, every job requires a lot of flipper coins, which just aren't sustainable to get after a few levels. Also, when you buy, upgrade/furnish, and sell houses, they don't seem to make any profit after you account for upgrade/furnishing cost. This basically means you can't play the game after running out of flipper coins. I hope these get fixed :(
Hannah Ware	5	November 13, 2020	Honest to goodness this game is really fun and super satisfying.

rose_xooo	1	November 13, 2020	Made an in app purchase of the starter pack. When I returned to game my new skins stayed, but all the work I did post purchase had disappeared and the currency received in purchase had disappeared as well. Have requested a refund from Google play that has been accepted. Very disappointing as I liked this game enough to spend money on it in the first place 😂😔

Anna Rosas	4	November 13, 2020	Cool but confusing
Caio Lucca	4	November 13, 2020	Pontos positivos: muito bem otimizado Pontos negativos: entendo que o jogo é gratuito, mas limitações como não ganhar o dinheiro imediatamente após a conclusão do trabalho são meio desnecessários, meio que querendo incitar você à comprar mais moedas (não só isso como várias outras coisas), mas como o jogo é grátis à gente passa pano

Lolcow Gaming	4	November 13, 2020	I like the game it's very fun and entertaining, but... I dislike how it makes you wait for your money or spend coins to get it. I get it for realism but if they wanted to be realistic some should be pay up front and some should make you wait because they are out of town or something.

Itll be more challenging and fun.

Rose	4	November 13, 2020	I recommend this game if you like renovating simulators. It has tasks to do in order to gain money, and you have free reign on your own properties. My only complaint is that coins are only earned when leveling up, and you need them to upgrade tools and get the pay from jobs without waiting hours for it

Silence	4	November 13, 2020	Honestly, this port is pretty awesome. Although, there is a lot of mobile game elements (i.e. In-app purchases) that really affects the game quite a bit. If you're searching for a good, fun mobile game, then i think you'll love this. They have simple controls, amazing gameplay, and smooth graphics. Of course, this doesn't compare to the PC version. And expect some mechanics where you have to spend some money in order to skip the progression.

Jessi	3	November 13, 2020	This game is quite good, it's fun and could be really addictive but the only problem is every time you complete a mission you have to either use in game coins or wait hours to receive payment. Being a free to play, you can't really complain, but I feel as if this game could be better.
Alaina Dorin	3	November 13, 2020	Don't like how it takes so long to get money. And you have to spend your money when completing tasks .

EPICAJCE25	2	November 14, 2020	Doesn't compare to the computer version. The computer one what made it fun was that you actually put the heater and electrical outlets on. When I played you just get dropped off in the house no tutorial on how to get to jobs. Also you need to use the flip coins to unlock stuff which is annoying just let us unlock it as we play. Tldr: game doesnt compare to the computer release.

Amber O	5	November 14, 2020	This follows the same game on console and PC but without some extra interactions, like installing fixtures. They've done a great job but I hate that you have to purchase items with the premium currency. It does look like you earn enough in game but it'll make decorating houses you buy more later game.

Cheyenne Hayden	4	November 14, 2020	Really addicting, the only issue I have are the controls are a tad wonky
Cheesie Christ	5	November 14, 2020	I bought this game on Steam the day it released. I play it on and off on there and I love it. When I saw it on the play store, i was a bit skeptical, but i tried it anyway. It's amazing. I'm blown away, honestly. It's so good. My phone is getting old too, and this game runs perfectly somehow. I don't know how you did it, but you did. 5 star, EZ Clap

Tobias Connor	4	November 14, 2020	This games very logical, and has a smooth relaxing theme to it, and like the steam version you have your very own office! My only request is to also allow us outside of our office and other homes like the steam version apart from that amazing game! 4 Stars - 1 From the fall of my request!

I thought new houses would appear in the estate agents but its empty. I enjoy doing the jobs but my favorite part was buying the houses and designing them. Can u add some more please,maybe make some off the clients houses available to buy as they seem 2 have better layouts then whats on offer.I love this game and want to continue so hopefully there will be an update soon.

Ryan Dumas	5	November 14, 2020	This is a great game and i'm really enjoying, but it's missing one of my favourite elements from the PC game: properly installing stuff. I didn't subtract stars because if I didn't know that was in the PC version i'd love this game and think it perfect. Also, the controls are super easy to use, intuitive, and adjustable. Super impressed. But I *really* want the installation mechanic
Jessica Hall	5	November 14, 2020	It is a pretty good game I like to clean up the stuff
AnIrishPotato Man	4	November 14, 2020	Probably the closest thing we'll get to actual house flipper on mobile, its pretty good. The controls can be a bit janky at times but its still a great gane about designing houses.

Team Poles	5	November 14, 2020	Good game
Charlotte Broadwater	5	November 14, 2020	I like this game
Abbert	4	November 14, 2020	I love this game. The waiting for hours sucked at first but once you buy the starter pack its instant which is nice. A cool feature to add would to be able to reject jobs. Or just see more than 4 at once. If you're a business order thats something you get to decide. But with having such a limited amount of flip coins and a job where you need to spend over 80 of them just to not get as many back makes it really difficult without paying money. Much faster than the pc version though.
Holden Franklin	5	November 14, 2020	I love this game, I recommend you get it, I don't have much to say except that this is a really really cool game.
Ava Boeseman	5	November 14, 2020	I love it i play it all day every day

Grace-full horses	3	November 14, 2020	Been playing for longer and its annoying that the only way to get those gold coins is to pay money bo watch or anything
That One Guy	5	November 14, 2020	Good i just wish you could unlock some items without spending the coins. Like if a job requires a certain paint to be unlocked you shouldn't have to buy the paint to use it just have it unlocked permanently after usieng it in the job.
Atharva Bharati	5	November 14, 2020	Nice
Sky foot	5	November 14, 2020	It is a good game they should make a second one

Crazy Pansos	5	November 14, 2020	One of the best house renovating and designing out there, I can't stop playing it, it's so good!
daniel ayala	5	November 14, 2020	I like the game very much it is very similar to the original house flipper but the only thing that I wish could be changed is having to use flip coins if that could be changed or taken off I would be very happy.
Shabrea Lassiter	5	November 14, 2020	Its batter then the last game i when i play it felt like it was the worse game i ever played but then i play this one beats the other game

Afatra	4	November 14, 2020	Nice graphic, Why it's all locked and when customer need it, we should unlocked it ourself using our flipacoin... That's not fair
Brown DiamondEyeZ	3	November 14, 2020	Love this game but needs updated to buy more real estate
[-NiKKo.XXE-]	5	November 14, 2020	Love it!!
Secrecy gaming	3	November 14, 2020	I enjoy the game. Runs very smoothly and has a lot of options for design. But I think itis dumb to have flipcoins for EVERYTHING. Once you get into the game a bit, it is nearly impossible to finish jobs without needing to buy flip coins. The rest of the game is great, but please either remove the coins, or put them on less items, like, WAY less items.
Delicious Johnson	5	November 14, 2020	Cool game except for getting stuck and I only used the flip coins for the levels

Liam Jansen	4	November 14, 2020	Great game......but the fact that you ahve to wait 4hrs to get paid is pretty dumb and more than likely unrealistic and so is the pricing for the decorations like $125 for a toothbrush

Grant P.	2	November 14, 2020	"While yes, the gameplay is amazing and there are a lot of features, the ""plot"", if you will, is not the best. And, you have to unlock items in the shop which is why I deleted it. I ran out of flipcoins and didn't want to buy any. I understand the dev's got to make money, but there has to be another way. I might look at this game in the future."
Nurul Najihah	5	November 14, 2020	BEST GAME EVERRRRRR
Andrew Henley	4	November 14, 2020	Very fun! The controls are a bit wonky, but the gameplay is easy once you get used to it. Though, the coin system is a bit annoying since I've had to do the same job to gain coins for other jobs and to unlock items. I think that the coins should only be for upgrading and unlocking. Otherwise, this game is very fun!

Brie Meneely	3	November 14, 2020	I really enjoy this game, but the biggest downfall, and why I'm gonna stop playing is the coins, they're required to purchase new paint, wallpaper, tiles, plants, etc. Basically everything and you don't earn them very fast, so now I find myself at a standstill because you also need those same coins to accept jobs. Please figure this out and let me know when I can return to play

Mohak Haldankar	3	November 14, 2020	I did not like the money system of the game that you have to give coins to get your money fast or else wait 4hours just to get the money.. That's just not fair.

James Duff	5	November 14, 2020	Love this game sooo much, but have hit a wall. Achievements tell me to spend more Flipcoins and buy/sell more houses. But there's only 6 available, hopefully more get added soon. Also, repeating story missions is a grind for the cash, need more of those too. All tools fully upgraded and living in the best house. Not a penny spent 👌
cikoi nsem	5	November 14, 2020	nice game

sʜᴇʀ	4	November 14, 2020	The best game for house flipper. You do not need energy to do something like the other house flipper game i had play. However, i do wish that for the payment, we get to watch ad and get an instant payment. But, overall, the game is good. No ads. You can even play offline!

There's no match 3 or silly overplayed quirks. Another bonus? I've been playing for hours and not one. single. ad. Download it for sure!

Ferdian Hendrasto	3	November 14, 2020	Essentially not a free game. Once you reach level 10, you won't be able to do jobs that require flipcoins. And flipcoins can only be obtained by achievements, level up, or purchasing with real money. It's a chill and good game, but the paywall hits rather quickly.
BBQ	5	November 14, 2020	A pretty good game.

Juan Carlos Rojas Lopez	5	October 14, 2020	It Is posible to login, but just as a guest, the game has incredible scenes but something that I don't like is that the game has too much autoquests and auto battle.
Rubb3rDucky GAMING	1	October 14, 2020	Downloaded the game but not able to log in. Non of the login methods are working
Jordan Angell	2	October 14, 2020	You know... I might actually like these games... if they were an actual game.. if I had to play them. Please take note of Genshin Impact... that's is a GAME... unlike this simulation of a game.
Ken Crowston	1	October 14, 2020	Another mmorpg that plays the game for you, very first in game quest can only be completed by using auto mode. Wish game developers would learn how to make modern mmorpg's for mobile devices, that actually let the gamer play the game them self like games are ment to be played! We want to play these games are self, we don't want to just sit here and watch the game play for me. Uninstalled like I do with all auto play mmorpg's!

Anuhlog	1	October 15, 2020	Trash, you can't even login with google it just says login failed... What a horrible launch, HUGE EPIC FAIL.. but then again it's probably better not to give ur google login Singapore... Finally got into the game but right after I made a character then had a loading screen the game keeps freezing ROFL prob the worst mobile release of the year, you don't even deserve 1 star for a game that doesn't even work..
Marcel Roussel	5	October 15, 2020	Good
Erick LeFou	4	October 15, 2020	Alright , Yes this game is an auto play first of all some may not like it its normal others may for obvious reason of being able to do something on side. Graphic are decent and combat is decent , yes you can auto combat but someone of the same gear doing manual will beat you, Cash shop isnt the wrost i saw after 40 game of this genra but they need to reduce the ammount of advantage from paying . And please dont say genshin impact is the best , Genshin have a lot of problems related to gaisha and content , graphic style and gameplay is fully different so you cannot compare both.

Reaper Razor	5	October 17, 2020	Login issue fixed
Wondermazing Honey Bees The Bee Team	2	October 19, 2020	Graphics are nice however there's too much auto play. I'm just not a fan of games where I simply hold my phone and watch the game play itself. If I wanted that I'd watch a movie instead of playing a game. In response to the developers comment. I said too much auto play. Only turning off auto battle doesn't eliminate the boredom of auto play as I watch my character run around doing everything with no imput from me.
Andrew Ash	1	October 20, 2020	This game is one of the worst money grabs I have played. You can spend hours getting experience and then a player with literally half your stats can beat you before you can blink due to the amount of money he has spent. There is no fair way to play without spending a lot of money 💷 and I mean in the hundreds!!!!! Don't play it....
J S	1	October 23, 2020	Auto path, pay to win trash game, looks and feels like every other Asian mmo before it, if you hate one youl hate them all, I'm done even trying them from now on.
Dean Barker	1	October 23, 2020	Probably would have been a good game if it wasn't for the auto play I want to play a character not watch it lvl up on its own
Dante Belmont	1	October 23, 2020	Ladies and gentlemen I bring you the biggest auto play game.
Norad ZX	1	October 23, 2020	Full autopilot game. You ruined your own game with this.
Dino Ben	5	October 23, 2020	Awesome
Death By Unicorn	1	October 23, 2020	The dev's needs to understand that when people say the autoplay is bad, they DONT mean auto combat (even though that's horrible too). Quests run themselves, your character moves themselves, and really, you dont have to do anything. The NPC placement is laughable (they just stand in a very convenient path), and generally, the game itself is pretty boring. Especially combat. A side note: Were you so put of ideas that one f your classes has to be an 8 year old with gigantic flintlocks?
Ferenc Mikola	1	October 24, 2020	The same copy-paste autoplay garbage as all the others
Weilan	1	October 24, 2020	The game has AUTO PLAY on everything, you can just leave it to play itself. There questing ends at level 59, which you reach in about 40-50 minutes of playing and after that the next level requires you o be level 60, but you can't reach it as you have done all your events for the day. Your last resort is to grind mobs that could take at least 9 hours to get the required XP to reach level 60. I don't know what happens in the game after that. There are zones that look like the old zones from the PC Forsaken World, but they require you to be level 100 in order to travel there. The game has almost zero gameplay or things to do aside from leaving AUTO PLAY to play the game for you and occasionally to collect rewards or enhance your gear. It feels more boring than playing FarmVille. The game is an absolute letdown.
Trizzy rozay	1	October 24, 2020	The old forsaken was way better then this , what was you guys thinking ? The pvp is sluggish might aswell play on auto , the old graphics and gameplay was way better on the old version , the social interface is not the best. As a old forsaken player it's not up to standards. I'm sorry to give you a bad review because the old version was one of the best games I've played in my life and I've played alot of mobile mmorpgs.
vasy N	1	October 24, 2020	Nice graphics, but you can play this game only with Wi-Fi connection for real?!?!? Delete and move to other game..such a let down....

Nyx Gamer	3	October 24, 2020	It heats up my phone and doesn't let me save the changes I make to a character I haven't got to the gameplay because the frame rate is so bad
Oliver C	1	October 24, 2020	The customized of your character are limited and you can't change gender in some class or customized your characters body as shown in the trailer. What a waste of a game.
Shrek-Ogre-Turbo-Cock	1	October 24, 2020	There isn't full character customization like advertised. You can only edit your face.
Juliet Warman	5	October 25, 2020	About time FW came to mobile I've played forsaken world since it first came to PC this mobile version is great I love it
DAVIDSON	1	October 25, 2020	Auto play, don't recommend to play - bad game, you can play waste your time
fonesafe	2	October 25, 2020	Great graphics - Way too much hand holding! Every second there is an icon and announcement to press this, do that. Unable to deactivate the auto battle feature which just starts at the beginning of each fight. The game practically runs itself without any human contact. Takes all the fun away of exploring and actual combat. Graphics and variety of options in character class and creation is top notch but it feels like the only time you are actively involved in the game.
Mantas Chan	5	October 26, 2020	Good ;)

Daniel Hayes	5	October 26, 2020	No marriage being forced on me!!! This is the same tried and true auto path auto battle mobile mmo you have all played, but it is so much better than all the others. Great graphics and visuals but doesn't heat up my phone. I don't have best connection but everything has run perfectly. Wish I had played the original because it's seems like it is made from the ground up for mobile. Hats off to the devs, long may your good work continue
Roscarnuk Ragnar	5	October 27, 2020	I don't get the low reviews this game is aweso me one of the best mmorgs out right now it needs bit of polishing but I'm sure it will keep improving great graphics easy 5 stars
NitroCorn	2	October 27, 2020	It's not good to have Auto Play and use the excuse that we can turn it off.. As then we are just going to be always slower than most. You simply shouldn't of added it.. Maybe quest 2 quest pathing would have been enough. I'm so disappointed.
Imarni Holder	5	October 27, 2020	Because there is auto play and follow so you can follow your guild without touching it and afk which is to not follow your guild and go somewhere else
Kim James	1	October 28, 2020	I had a game already started I was level 111 and now when I open the game its saying I have to make a new character and I cant find my profile
Aston Barnes	2	October 29, 2020	Just another game that plays itself, this time with fancy graphics. I made it to about lvl 51 in 20mins by basically just pressing one button. Unfortunately this just means that I now have no idea how to actually play the game myself. Also you keep just saying you can click an icon to disable auto battle, but noone is going to do that if auto play is there. Basically just shooting yourself in the foot. Such a let down.
Dimitar Dimitrov	5	October 29, 2020	Nice game
James Mcbeth	4	October 30, 2020	Awesome graphics and very easy to play, but just a bit too linear to earn a 5 star rating

Lewis Samsung	2	October 30, 2020	Was playing this game every day was doing very well paid has well was looking bad ass but tryed playing today my account has full gone got put on new sever was in 1 server the lot was level 90 was a great power at near 2000 in four days of playing none stop then this keep a eye at
Robyn C	4	November 1, 2020	Amazing effects. Great performance. Extremely enjoyable. However, after a certain amount of time, you can no longer do anything on the game and can't level up.
Tracey Truelove	1	November 1, 2020	URGENT : Why was my account restricted? I use Twitter to sign in and get a message saying I must pass a capita check system to prove I'm not a BOT. The twitter proof page doesn't work, and I've spent actual money on my character that I now CAN'T PLAY. I'm super annoyed. I AM NOT A BOT and would like my account back...
sarah-jayne brown	1	November 1, 2020	Good game but loaded with bugs. Recharge at own risk. If it fails, support is unlikely to reply, they seem to be non existent...... Edit: the above review was 3 stars as at the time I was still waiting on a reply from support. Almost 2 weeks later, still no reply to an 'expedited ticket' which has been bumped twice by mods in the discord support server. Game still has issues that lock me out of events, a mini game quest that hasn't worked since day 1 and is more money hungry despite its issues.
Marlon green	5	November 2, 2020	Just excellent game! Very well rounded! Dam! Keep it up!.
Ryan Mcnamara	4	November 3, 2020	It was good but you need to update the software for the game
S	1	November 4, 2020	Hackers are cheating in pvp with instant kills
Mārcis Ulmanis	3	November 5, 2020	It's an ok mmorpg, but needs a lot of improvement. You need to make this game more open world, without map lock/area lock. Thats kinda ruining this mmo experience!
Mārcis Ulmanis	3	November 5, 2020	Okay mmorpg, but needs a lot of improvement. You need to make this game really open world like perfect world mobile ect. without map lock/area lock. Thats kinda ruining all experience of this game.
SWORD MASTER	1	November 5, 2020	Worst grapic all things about this game is bead
James Krik	3	November 5, 2020	Honestly this game is easy to fix. 1. Add Npc's to fill out player slots in co-op gameplay areas so you can actually play everything. 2. Add quest removal and decline options for all non story mode quests. 3. Pay to win is seperate from free player pvp. 4. Social media integration should be optional not forced. 5. Make your pricing fair not greedy, VIP 10$ a month and non pvp attire for aesthetic appeal only at 10$ per costume. Then it's a perfect as a game can be. Now why is that so hard huh?
Janeane Picatoste	4	November 5, 2020	It's an amazing game, lots of bugs still but as expected in a beta phase. Though priest heals are kind of useless.
chad fraser	3	November 5, 2020	Its pretty ambitious. Poor execution though. There is alot ti be explained but you only get 10 words on screen befire it gets cut off and you will never have another opportunity to read the explanation of game mechanics. Youre on your own. I wouldnt recommend spending money on this- im nearly the highest level mage on my server with $0 spent - but theres always people with hundreds of dollars to spend that will always always beat you .
Patrick Kyo	4	November 5, 2020	The game is almost perfect with the full character custom but once I deleted my character I can't use the same name again when I recreate my character.
Dumbuleu Cosmin	5	November 5, 2020	it's such a good game.
Alexandru Florea	4	November 7, 2020	Awesome Game but money make the difference

Jeff Nehring	1	November 9, 2020	I really want to play this game however it will not allow me to connect to the servers. Definitely need to fix so I can play!
Jamie Ramirez	2	November 9, 2020	I was so excited when I prereg for this game and then I was elated when I found out that there was a vampire class and then I was instantly disappointed when each class has a set gender role that you can play I'm not a fan of that option if I play as a character I want to be able to choose my gender because I want to play The Vampire but I should be able to choose to be a female because I'm a woman I'm a female gamer I don't want to play as a male vampire so I intantly uninstalled it
Ken Inciso	1	November 9, 2020	Only 1 server for all continents. I can't enter coz it's already full
Atreo-Aj Gaming	5	November 9, 2020	More improvement
Michael Pollie	1	November 9, 2020	Right off the bat have to wait 20 minutes to play because of servers.....no thanks....
Ricky Sardido	1	November 9, 2020	No indication of how many files need to download during updating. 1 hr is enough to wait and still downloading. So not good thinking when will it finish
Karri Clinger	2	November 9, 2020	Havent been able to play yet because the only server available is full with a 15-20 minute wait. Please add more servers.
Brian Bernier	1	November 9, 2020	Not going to wait in queue for a full server. Get your act together.
Eclipse_YT	1	November 9, 2020	Server is full... Really? You're crazy if you think I'm waiting 20 minutes to play your generic game.
Zeko BaSh_01	1	November 9, 2020	Why there's only one server ?!! Can't you guys open another one so we can join instead of keep waiting like this 😐🤦‍♂️
benjamin altman	2	November 9, 2020	The sever keep saying full each of them
Robert Thomas	5	November 9, 2020	Love it make a forsaken world 2
Kareem Khairy	1	November 9, 2020	I can't play because of the server
FQY PW	1	November 9, 2020	Another mobile mmorpg clone. Involves power levels. Automatic walking and fighting. Pay to win purchases. I assume it has wings too. Etc etc Game looks good! But the rest is boring and a direct copy of all the others mobile mmorpgs. Do I recommend it? No Why? If you don't spend real money you will never get on the same league as people that spend all their money.
E A	1	November 9, 2020	Pppppppppppffffffff
and peggy	2	November 9, 2020	Edited review since I finally got in the game, good graphics but full auto and genderlocked classes, its 2020 step up your game ffs.
PsychoWilly 1419	1	November 9, 2020	I tried to play but it kept saying server was full and there's only one server... why can we download the game but not play it? It doesn't make sense to download this game so it's not worth the time or phone space..
Cle Ric	5	November 9, 2020	Good game!
Roido Asakura	1	November 9, 2020	The game practically plays for itself. Uninstalled.
hero Anjani	5	November 9, 2020	THE Game Is Cool It's Auto You Can Play While Sleep And When You Awake Your Level Will Be Big And Thanks To Developer For Releasing This Game I'm Gonna Support You By Playing The Game And Thanks ☺️
-ERROR-	1	November 9, 2020	Can't connect to survers.
Matt Kuipers	2	November 9, 2020	This was the best game ever. I've spent well over $200 in game this past week alone. Now the update today and everything is gone! All progress, all purchases etc! We have to start all over again?! THIS IS INSANE!
Sufea Nabila	1	November 9, 2020	server full .........
5-HT	5	November 9, 2020	i have 3gb of space,but the spamming popup appears saying please clear storage,the graphic is superb,but the animation skill is just a bit poor.
Hasnizan Hasbullah	5	November 9, 2020	It's a nice game we can change the mode of attack to manual I like it...graphic is very good
Slayer TM	1	November 9, 2020	Game looks good, Sadly that's not the case. Good try tho~ Huge money grab, auto-play, No real skill play, No Dodge feature for high skill play, Kinda boring.
CJ Nealy	1	November 9, 2020	There's other games like Black Desert Mobile that do this formula better. This game doesn't look that great, doesn't run that great, and the servers are really laggy.
Kevin Hill	3	November 9, 2020	This game is cool, but the attack animation is Soooo delayed! Please fix this. Uninstall until it is.
Tiana Howell	2	November 9, 2020	Once i finish login I tap to play And they say the sever is full and that i have to wait in line Please fix your game🥺🥺🥺
noodles noodle	1	November 9, 2020	One of my childhood PC game. I loved this game so much, I was expecting so much more in this game but hence, it's just another game where I just watch it play itself. Sigh~ I had high hopes for this game since it was part of my life. Such a let down.
Choco Bunno	3	November 9, 2020	I don't like the movement it feels like every other game. Also for darker skin, the eye's change with it.
areowewhy haha	1	November 9, 2020	don't even try to think to install the game. Too boring, the only good part is when creating the character. 50k+ downloads only but their server can't support the load of player who wants to play the game. When you create the character, it will look good in the creation process but not in the actual game. Poor gameplay, poor graphics, and poor game. Black Dessert Mobile is way too better than this, but still I uninstalled it lol. Nice try, Devs. bye.
Cristian Orrellana	5	November 9, 2020	Bueno muy bueno
Aurora Selene	1	November 9, 2020	Really, 1 server for north America.. lol off to a good start already. Seems like they rushed to get this game out to people, and already having difficulty even getting onto the only server..
Russell Vanoystaeyen	1	November 9, 2020	Open more servers.....
Jeff Woods	1	November 9, 2020	I just installed it and its already refusing me to put a username the server been full for the past 4 hours i can't even begin to play....the game have so much potential but its too big and apparently not enough servers available
Diablo	5	November 9, 2020	💎💎💎💎💎
Jeannie Torres	1	November 9, 2020	How i have been waiting for this game to come out, finally it does to just have to wait to play because there is only one server, smdh
Ninja Spinner	1	November 9, 2020	Autoplay... so boring..... Yawn, Zzz
Seth Emerson	1	November 9, 2020	Played about 20min and just said no way!!! First i couldnt even play at full graphics due to the game telling me my device cant handle it when i can i can play dragon raja real engine 4 on full settings no problem. 2nd its a forced auto quest and combat. 3rd the movement is just trash hands down.4th you can tell there was just little effort in making a polished game and just rushed to get in the market to make money. This will be auto p2w. This game is forsaken.
Mehmet YIKILMAZ	1	November 9, 2020	Another p2w game don't waste your time
Kate Sloan	1	November 9, 2020	Can't play it keeps saying server is full and I pre-registered
aaron bowen	2	November 9, 2020	Less than mediocre Pros: Looks good. Plenty of class options. Seems like it's not really pay to win. I like the costumes. Mounts and character models all look dope. Cons: straight up auto. Combat is far too boring to want to manual. Various systems and features are barely explained. UI is cluttered. Voice acting is horrible. Hot take: just another cash grab social MMO that takes no skill or effort and inflates e-peens everywhere into thinking you rock for spending money on this tripe.
munchkin kitten	3	November 9, 2020	I love perfect world games, and this game is really good just wish it wasnt to laggy and wish we can be a fox girl and change the gender of wat class u actually wanna be
Alanda woodland plays	1	November 9, 2020	It keeps saying that the server is full you guys should start making more servers
Hunter Johnson	1	November 9, 2020	Ut wont get me in the game keeps say contection error and send me to my home page
amber Walker	3	November 9, 2020	Lags and needs gender and race choices for the different classes
MEGA KINGGAMES	5	November 9, 2020	Good job Team developers 😁👍
The Doctor	1	November 9, 2020	Can't get into the server. You would think that they would have their servers prepared for launch day.
Shameless Keyboard warrior	1	November 9, 2020	Disappointed... your typical mobile rpg
Jetstream Attano	1	November 9, 2020	A single server for a MMO how unprofessional
mainul islam	1	November 9, 2020	😑😑😑
Dark Elf	2	November 9, 2020	This ia just another game plays itself. Nothing fancy about it, the graphics are great and all and cute pets n mounts ect.. But im not really impressed by it, game dc me several times and laggy. Too many bugs.
Meshal Alihaibi	5	November 9, 2020	حول اللغة من عربي الى انقليزي بتشتغل وبتنحل مشكلة التحميل
John Swatton	1	November 9, 2020	Good game but done update and lost everything
james p	2	November 9, 2020	Best game play ever! If you enjoy watching a game play itself. Autoplay 👎
Punkiie Mariie	5	November 9, 2020	I seriously love this game! Reminds me of Dragon Raja, the only difference is, I can be a Vampire!!! Nice graphics too! I love that i can auto move and auto fight, and turn it off if i want too!!
Reizo RONIN	1	November 9, 2020	"Another ""Autoplay Junk Game"" in Playstore! I'm tiring with developers who created this kind of game. MMORPG supposed to be fun to play. But all i do is just watching this game played for itself. I don't know where the fun from watching game play for itself. Don't wanna waste my money for Autoplay Games. 1 star, sorry. Hope U devs create Full Control MMORPG Next Time, without any autoplay button!!!"
Christine Joy Dela Cruz	2	November 9, 2020	super lag..
Explorers Space & Time	5	November 9, 2020	Semoga games ini langgeng sampai kiamat
Andrew Perlman	1	November 9, 2020	Generic autoplay. Meh Uninstalled in 2 minutes. Pass.
Egidijus Juodis	1	November 9, 2020	After update my Acc was lost . All purchase all lost ... whats going on ?!??!?! I use tonplay on EU - 2 , now there is no even a srver on the list .... sereosly ?!??!
keph	1	November 9, 2020	Did not like this game.
yoo nii	2	November 9, 2020	Let's start with the positive things first: graphics are real nice and so is the sound. on the other side, too much auto play on literally everything. leveling up is way too fast, I played for roughly 50 minutes and I'm on lvl 61 already whilst pressing maybe one button? tbh this ain't worth my time. I'd rather go back to some other mmorpg with less auto play and better pvp, quest and boss options. a real let down.
Mabe O	2	November 9, 2020	You guys probably should have spent a bit more time on this before release, so buggy and just plain poorly polished now that it's not worth playing.
Robert John Genete	1	November 9, 2020	How can I attack if the user interface is gone? What a lame game
Dave Danao	5	November 9, 2020	Nice game
raed d	1	November 9, 2020	This game is about a lot of women and this is a trash
Anthony Machtelinckx	2	November 9, 2020	Nice graphics and idea's but poorly executed. Skill animation is funny.. Looks like you attach 10 times but only hit once. Also the game isn't fps friendly (if that makes sense). Don't waist your time.
Brandon McGuire	1	November 9, 2020	I was expecting a game that I actually play not sit there and have everything done automatically which is quite frankly not fun
Dracoleonellus Populusdeltoides	1	November 9, 2020	Decepción total después de que reinician todo y mi inversión en el juego se fue, gracias por nada!
Arno Mot	3	November 9, 2020	too many one star that said, autoplay..i hate it too.. , actualy im excited to install and play the game ,but now im not excited anymore.. i hope every developer learn from this game that some or many player hate the game with autoplay even you can disable it..., i dont give 1 star but i dont give 5 star.. im jut dispointed that my excited is gone when i know autoplay
Mizutsch Shikigiri	2	November 9, 2020	The graphics are good and its fun because i can design my character its just the game is buggy- its not moving like i want its just moving itself-✌️✌️✌️
BELOW AVERAGE	2	November 9, 2020	There's Forsaken World Mobile that I used to play before was more awesome than this. The graphics before and gameplay is way more better than this new one. Dont know if developer of that game is still the Dev of this game but it's missing lots of fixing.
Faith Padgett	1	November 9, 2020	Couldn't even get in the first time I loaded in and made my character it bugged out and kicked me out the second time I loaded the game I can't even connect to a server to join
Jer Christian	1	November 9, 2020	Another click and go to mission game with zero effort put into. Just like every other game claiming to be open world. Its just click and go no actual user needed to do quests or complete them.
Jamael Martin	5	November 9, 2020	It's really fun and I already enjoy it
Anton Ilchenko	1	November 9, 2020	Hard to rate more due to game play itself
Laura Fiss	1	November 9, 2020	If you are going to launch a game based on pre-registration, then you should have several servers..so far this game is very very very slow and laggy.
Shappiskar	5	November 9, 2020	"Honestly I expect more from this game. ""Be unique"" How can we be unique if there is a gender lock there? We are not free to choose our character's gender, neither their race. Missions are boring, we just tap and tap to talk to someone, and everything is auto quest. (we don't like auto quest) And there is lag, since you start creating your character the game is slow. The game just got lunch so I hope you improve this game. And remember we like pvp and pk :)"
Brandon Parent	1	November 9, 2020	Well had high hopes for the game but didn't know it was going to be mostly auto. Some people may like it story seemed neat but was a bit boring for me.
Salar Amirian	2	November 9, 2020	Good game but why game is lag ? I try to use vpn to fix lag but not working . And heros attacks or quest in game to much lag sorry but i uninstalled game cant pkay lag bad ping game
Raith Enchanted	1	November 9, 2020	Another p2w just like it's pc version, then again it is perfect world game.
MeLi -	1	November 9, 2020	Reconnecting .. Reconnecting always cant play the game
Lutece -	1	November 9, 2020	Unistalled
FairTooWell	1	November 9, 2020	not working only showing a blue screen
Kub Lis	1	November 9, 2020	First recharge gifts is bugged. You can't see it and claim it. Only pop up saying you need to be lv. 6
Andy Yudystian	3	November 9, 2020	Started with 3, have some delay while attacking, teleport, talk with npc and etc. Hope some improvement in next update
bobet jobe	2	November 9, 2020	This game is pretty but that's about it. The character creator is detailed, but classes are gender locked and you can't customize body proportions. The one aspect that totally ruins this game is everything is auto. No option to limit the auto-pathing and you have to turn off auto combat for every single fight.
Maof Gaming	1	November 9, 2020	Hmmm nowadays this kind of rpg is not really good to make unless it has an amount of ads before release, i have a suggestion since the dev are very good try to make a game which not focus on full 3D, a lot of people is not using good mobile phone , players prefer a loot kind of game like orignal rgnarok and focus on sellin skins for devs profit, I'm a long player of rpg but havent yet satisfied when it comes to gamplay, rgnarok is good but 3d games really not good if not designed well like wotv
Hannajo Perritt	1	November 9, 2020	I downloaded the game when I open the game it wont even load it just gives me a blue screen. May change rating if the game is even any good
Derrick Campbell	1	November 9, 2020	Gender lock so with me that means uninstall. Once I see a game that is gender lock I stop playing and uninstall.
Revenant Emperor	3	November 9, 2020	I will come back when graphic settings on the character customization screen is allowed to go lower cause its laggy. I play black dessert and have no issues w lag on that advanced customization screen. Was not gonna slug through a laggy customization cuz theres passion in making the virtual you in any game for I.
Kage Taylor	2	November 9, 2020	I played for about 1 minute after creating my character. The graphics and character design are amazing, really good quality, and the games layout is good, but the movement and camera control is so bad I'm already uninstalling. I hope you will update it to be have more smooth body and camera control, because then it's potential will really be able to shine through. Games like PUBG Mobile and Call of Duty Mobile have good character and camera movement you could attempt to emulate.
Mahmud Reza Akash	2	November 9, 2020	The game needs to be optimized. The combat skill buttons dont response on time. Also when in auto combat, manual skill press doesnot seems to work. The auto quest system had this delay between finishing quest and taking new quest
lans kie	1	November 9, 2020	Its data consuming game..evrey 4mins consume 200mb... immediately uninstall this is similar to leagcy discord when the devs update to pc game then the data consuming occur..i played 1hour in legacy discord consume 4gigabyte ..its bad for using only data ...verybad..
thad barnes	1	November 9, 2020	This game is worthless. Autoplay cash grabs are for China!
Phantoms	1	November 9, 2020	It's an ugly game. You expect the great RPG like in the picture that they describe it. NO IT'S NOT GREAT. This game is money laundering.
Gaige	2	November 9, 2020	The combat control system is a huge problem
Mark Bonaobra	5	November 9, 2020	Gud game
《Neko》 [San]	4	November 9, 2020	Gamenya bagus grafiknya juga buat hp menengah udh lumayan trus kontrolnya juga simple gk ribet tapi sayangnya kadang nih game agak delay waktu mencet skill atau waktu scene itu suaranya malah duluan daripada subtitle nya dan yang terakhir itu kadang waktu lagi battle dan mode auto nya dimatiin malah tiba tiba aktif sendiri. Tapi terlepas dari itu semuanya udah bagus
Andi Hendrawan	5	November 9, 2020	Good game
Andre Livingston	1	November 9, 2020	So disappointed it keeps freezing and if thats not bad enough it wont let me play I keep tapping but cant get Through the openin

Stymie Gunther	1	November 9, 2020	Trash game sound quality is so bad game is extremely laggy. Auto complete is worthless my Character literally stands out of range of the enemies just swinging his sword like crazy hitting nothing.

Sekar Wahyu Channel Official	4	November 9, 2020	Games really good But why i cant have logend with games...i love this please fixit ok
Bob Kevin Bataller	1	November 9, 2020	You can't move while fighting.. you can only do one. For example in fighting. If you want to move. You can't hit. Also you can't hit while moving around. You just have to stand there hit and be hit.
The • Demonz	1	November 9, 2020	Fix a game !
John K	2	November 9, 2020	Game was okay. But not much there... Just same general MMO for mobile. Auto grind auto quest.. that's about it. Cool graphics... nothing fully original. 2/5 as review
Raihan Zulfikar	5	November 9, 2020	Nice game
Fernandgil Carupo	3	November 9, 2020	Good game it's promising but full of bugs even my net is very fast I always disconnect to server..why?

HYPE CAT	1	November 9, 2020	It's a good game. But the problem is that the game is keep telling me that I don't have internet connection and I have to connect to the server. But I am connected to a wifi. Please fix this is immediately. Your game will not earn a profit if you don't do something about this issue. I'll change my review in this game if everything is good now.
mahdi mahdimashhad	2	November 9, 2020	Im dont undrestand where is the vip card and bad There is a problem connecting to the game
Emily Rose	2	November 9, 2020	I gave it two stars because of the amazing graphics. Other than just graphics, I couldn't even log on to the server, I have 4 bar Wi-Fi and was still unable to connect.

Okay...it's your own game,your own rule,so when it feels like ""another BORING AUTO MMORPG"" to me then my rule is just WALKAWAY,there are so many games in playstore."
sharon venom	1	November 9, 2020	wish I could give -⭐, shame on u with this none-playable game, login issues explains enough that how garbage this game is, these Asian companies think only with graphics they can win players but in 99.99% of their game you'll see tons of bugs & issues that makes u hate that game no matter how good they look.. I don't need your copy paste massage 👎🏻 Big failure

nicholas alcorn	2	November 9, 2020	I gave this game 3 hours of my life, just to test it out. If you are into autoing a game, this is for you. I auto played the 3 hours and got to 100k power, level 80. Classes are gender locked. I dont even know what my skills did tbh. Just auto auto auto. Yes, there is a way to turn off autoing everything but you'd probably fall behind everyone else. Only has 1 server. Multiple languages were being spoken at once. Decent graphics, though because it was just released, I had to turn down my setting
Todd M	1	November 9, 2020	Won't connect to servers

FatherLucifer -	1	November 9, 2020	Nothing similar to forsaken world or perfect world by any means. (Kinda leaves the players who sunk their hearts into the original a bad taste). The autoplay is overdone, regardless of the option not to have it. This could have been done alot better but sadly hopes and dreams were crushed to the typical cash grab for auto-play mmos. :/ Never took the time to write a review on a game till this launched...

Now after maintenance everything gone??? I did not even receive any first recharge items. Whenever i there's a prompt for recharge items, i clicked view but it states that it will be unlocked at level 6 when im already lv96.
LeRohn McClelland	3	November 9, 2020	Very buggy and laggy and some features dont work and the words for a lot of things are cut off its hard to read
LISA SCALLION	3	November 9, 2020	Enjoyable from what I had seen so far. I really didn't get a chance to play much because it got shut down for maintenance. So I'm only going to give it a three star rating for now . I might change it depending on how the game is when I get into playing it further. As for now I won't be spending money on it . Maybe later down the line If the game is worth it. At this point I don't know because I can't seem to connect to the game since the maintenance took place.

Will update rating when I'm able to play. ***UPDATE***After reading a ton of reviews, I'm completely turned off. Not even gonna give the game a chance.
Brian De Leon	1	November 9, 2020	What happened when I start playing this game there were no servers now I can't find the character I've played fpr hours..
TrishAngela C.	3	November 9, 2020	It's fun but how to save your character.... I mean I return to lvl 1 again any idea hahaahha.... When creating character it's debugging and I love the fight scene when I am level 65 but now I return to lvl1
Syke	2	November 9, 2020	I'm pissed. It was such a cool game at first, and I went full out just grinding my levels, BUT THEN THE SERVER KEPT DISCONNECTING AND I LOST ALL MY PROGRESS, there's also many other bugs, like the creating character process? . I loved the concept, hope there would be more games like this but yall let me down on this one.

ecchi poro	4	November 9, 2020	Compared to the original pc game this is what happened: The ditched some main/side quests, Its lacking races and some classes, Every race had his own starting area with unique quest line explaining the story. Pay to win is stil a thing. The improvments the made how ever is also notable, Better grafics, movement and combat feel less wonky, U dont need to pay to advance, but u will get stronger at pvp and potential get some dope costumes/mounts

David F	1	November 9, 2020	Disappointed, after playing & starting on US-1 I try to log back into the game & it now has servers 1 - 4 & servers 1 - 3 are full & will not let me in. Therefore I cannot play my character I created & spent all the time playing yesterday. Forcing me to make a new one & join server 4.. Which why would I even bother, just to be locked out of server 4 later today or tomorrow when it becomes full. If the server hits max limit then stop letting new players in locking previous players out! 😣😵

Sam Barber	1	November 9, 2020	Yall took my old profile taking threestars at least giving 2 being a good game. Decided to change to 1 star not worth time any more didnt even get compensated cant trust them.
Da Vinzy	1	November 9, 2020	My level 60 character is gone. I bind it on my facebook but when i logged in again it's gone
Vic Meckes	2	November 9, 2020	great game if they fix the glitching. i slpwed down resolutions and no help. takes 1 min to accept any quest or turn in. Dont seem like a lot of time but when your level grinding it takes way 2 much time. other then that great game with lots of potential
Phattida Ratchasin	5	November 9, 2020	i like this game but sometimes it glitches me with something but its great game
Jonn Elijah	1	November 9, 2020	Kept on asking me to clear phone space even though I still have more spare space.
Amfu Gaming	1	November 9, 2020	SERVER LOST TIME TO TIME HAHAHAHAH 1STAR FOR THIS GAME AND UNISTALL IT GUYS . YOU WASTING TIME FOR DOWNLOADING IT .
Kim Chandler	1	November 9, 2020	There is no game.... Is crashes as soon as you open the app. What a disappointment
vancestyle Shadow	1	November 9, 2020	This game is sadly just like every other RPG game in the play store granted it does have some unique forms such as vampire but gameplay is essentially the exact same there is no differentiating factors between this RPG and any other in the play store this is really sad seeing as how I pre-registered for this app needless to say disappointment is an understatement when I expect new games to come out in the play store I don't expect them to be carbon copies of every other game in the play store.
Ruben Edica	1	November 9, 2020	2star because of so. Many bug like flashing white and white background also repeated words. Thanks. I'll back play if they fixed it huhu..
Andrew Heath	1	November 9, 2020	Level 60 character on server 1, now it won't let me in. New server, new character, no thank you.
reload bond	5	November 9, 2020	100% Interesting.
JP pasta	1	November 9, 2020	Everytime I open the game, I need to start all over again. I'm getting sick of making the characters agaaain
John Clifford Bambao	5	November 9, 2020	Nc
Gwyneth Anne Abad	2	November 9, 2020	This is actually a good game but really tons of bugs. I don't know why it's super glitchy when our internet is doin' fine and my phone has a big storage and ram. I do understand that this game maybe is under development but it's just.. I expected more. Nevertheless, I like how the story flows and the graphics that's why I give stars for that. Another complaint the auto-battle thing just confuses me. I'm literally just watchin' my phone do its thing and not understand a thing from the game.
Tyler Vineyard	1	November 9, 2020	Auto play game and after openinging app again all data was lost
Jacob Gonzales	1	November 9, 2020	Played yesterday for about 4 hours 2 on each character had both level 50 got on today just to see i lost both character terrible game.
Michael Poindexter	1	November 9, 2020	Game is too laggy for anyone to play would love to rate it more but cant
Michelle Martin	2	November 9, 2020	I cant even get in the game. My wifi is on and it still wont let me in
Noel Villarosa	3	November 9, 2020	The game is good but this random disconnect so bad, please fix. Thanks
Jayda Storm	2	November 9, 2020	I didn't even get past the customization suite. I don't care for not being able to choose your gender when selecting a class. I'd have loved to be a female Rogue or a female vampire.
Tavon Taylor	5	November 9, 2020	Great game
ragnarok1 rom	2	November 9, 2020	trash game
Legend Empire	5	November 9, 2020	Good game keep with the good work and I hope this game get any further updates because iam so hyped for this thank you all
Ozan Berk Polat	1	November 9, 2020	I am unable too see which server is my main character on! You better put some kind of an indicator for that matter
40oz & sober	1	November 9, 2020	Huge let down I thought new games are supposed to take off auto tracking and auto combat what's the use of playing if it plays by it self
Mari Jhay	1	November 9, 2020	Really? 59 lvl max?
Joanna Sebastian	1	November 9, 2020	Too much auto movement
Andika Inu	2	November 9, 2020	Make ur game non-auto to play & it will be great game.i mean,it has nice grapic & interesting chara ability but yaa it full-auto-play.Maybe in this game u can choose auto or not by tapping like-computer icon, but still as long it has auto-play,many people will say its boring game.
Harry M	5	November 10, 2020	Fit
Vaverlis	1	November 10, 2020	"My entire account got deleted out of nowhere. I made an account on the ""America"" server and now that server isn't even there. No warning of changing the servers to ""US-#"". Time completely wasted... If I had spent money, I'd sue the company."
Lorence Andi Malejana	1	November 10, 2020	Well that sucked
Anthony Cunningham	1	November 10, 2020	Game sucks now. After your maintenance. I cant access the server or my character and am being forced to create a new one. Not worth the time
Our Speciality FMS	2	November 10, 2020	It shows the home screen the it says tap anywhere to start I tap and it shows the loading icon I wait for a some seconds and then it stops and I keep trying and it stops so I'm not sure what's wrong please respond I really want to play bad though :(
D Thompson	1	November 10, 2020	Never even got to try to play it would crash at 32% no matter what i did reinstalled differnt server so I'll try again in a fewdays to see what happens but until then 1 star
UwU OwO	1	November 10, 2020	Buga lag glitches
Roi Paraiso	2	November 10, 2020	Another game that looks good but brought down by heavy reliance on auto play. What's the point of a game that plays itself.?
Natasha Marie	2	November 10, 2020	"Game was great till the patch or serve update.. game is up to date and now I can not log into ANY of the 3 servers without it saying ""failed to connect to server"" :( EDIT: I made a character got passed lvl 60 really quick.. had the issue with the servers.. now that's fixed but my Character is Gone. I am beyond unimpressed."
AceGamer 2099	1	November 10, 2020	My only character is locked in US-1 server and it's always full, please fix it.
Rektz one	2	November 10, 2020	Trying to log into u.s. server 1 can't log in please make some room for the server. Not making another character on other server. Already spent money
William Savage	1	November 10, 2020	this game was big dissapointment i preregistered and was looking forward to playing it created a char and couldnt get past the server loading screen been doing this to me since download
David Ioane	1	November 10, 2020	The game wont even work but it looks like this game is a fraid to begin with how disappointing
Odie Harper	5	November 10, 2020	Sweet game
Temmie cuteness	1	November 10, 2020	I downloaded it and only played at most a minute it was so slow felt like I was on a computer that was gonna crash plus you can't even chose your gender for the class you want u can only be a male (I was gonna be a roag) don't get this game
Tommy K.	2	November 10, 2020	It was good until I logged out.... tried logging in this morning and it just sits on the main screen after tapping anywhere to start 4 times. Not sure if it's on my end or what. But I can't login to play....
Frost Gaming	1	November 10, 2020	It says it cant connect to server
Playez Gaming	1	November 10, 2020	Played like 5 hours yesterday. Now I cant even login to my server/character because its to full or something. Refund asap.
Lonni Mcloven	5	November 10, 2020	Please 🥺🙏 let me be a female vampire all, the music in this game is beautiful where can I listen to the music outside the game? #endgenderlock
Rewind	3	November 10, 2020	Great game, loved it for about 5 seconds when I realized it was another auto playing game. Why do devs make games that play themselves?? I was so excited to start playing it. Rpg gamers dont want to just tap a quest button every so often. We want to grind and play. Oh well, guess Ill keep searching
John Patrick Puro	1	November 10, 2020	I like the game but after I closed it, can no longer retrieve my account, I linked it with my google account but cannot retrieve it anymore, kindly fix this, wanna play more but already disappointed.
Alexandria Cantrall	1	November 10, 2020	I couldn't even start the game. Even using wifi i was able to make my character but thats it the game closes after it tries to go farther. I was excited to play this game but now i have to delete.
TheLife4Jesus	1	November 10, 2020	Just another bland MMORPG without any personality of its own. Writing is terrible, and avatar customization is minimal. Autoplay can be turned off of course, but WHY do so many of these games even have autoplay? The point of a game is to do it yourself.
Thanatos Jynx	5	November 10, 2020	I love it but I can't get pass lvl 59 not sure if its a bug or something
Jack O' Keeffe	5	November 10, 2020	Good game to be fair. Played it yesterday all day, and woke up this morning and all my save data was gone. I was about level 80.
50k subs without video	4	November 10, 2020	Overall, it's a fun game, customisation is awesome and gameplay is great, starting off my Youtube channel with this game, this game is taking up alot of battery, which I do mind abit, still, it's an awesome little game!
Richard Lousich	3	November 10, 2020	Beautiful game. Shame it had autoplay.
Red spicey	1	November 10, 2020	It takes up to much storage!
NotaShorty	3	November 10, 2020	Maybe I missed something, but how come I couldn't be a rouge, and a girl? Like, I can't find a option to change the gender of whatever class you pick. If there isn't one, then that's pretty disappointing. I'll change this again after a while of playing after I decide out of Priest, Mage, and Gunner.
Jinx Warwillow	2	November 10, 2020	Buggy , and it's all auto play.
Cletus McFetus	1	November 10, 2020	STOP SUPPORTING THESE PREDATORY COMPANIES! JOIN THE MOVEMENT! TEAM 1*! BRING DOWN THESE COMPANIES AND HELP BRING BACK REAL GAMES FOR ALL TO PLAY FAIR WITH NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!!!!
Neo Zero	1	November 10, 2020	Just like any android game nowadays with auto play
Damon Secrettie	5	November 10, 2020	Fun
SAGaming Bros	5	November 10, 2020	This game is amazing but I wish it was more like dragon raja
Jennifer Sturgess	2	November 10, 2020	Game is to laggy.nice graphics tho.
Lilan .A	5	November 10, 2020	Amazing game❤❤
Roman	1	November 10, 2020	Waste of Time, ASIAN ONLY SERVERS ( ALL EU, US SERVERS ARE IN ASIA ENJOY CHINESE TIME ZONE AND 300 PING!) , MONEY GRAB, AUTO 100% PLAY. ALL SHOULD GIVE THIS 1* AND REMOVE FROM PLAYSTORE. Its not GLOBAL launch its Chinese SERVER LOL.
Kevin Cheng	1	November 10, 2020	Game lost all of my information and now I have to start a new account. Terrible.
Deanna Wright	5	November 10, 2020	i love this game
Brent Brave	2	November 10, 2020	Boring game that plays itself. Pretty characters and world but boring.
King Crab	3	November 10, 2020	Completely auto. Even when turn off it fights by its self.
rachel rush	2	November 10, 2020	Eh. There are better games to play. I didn't really like the way this game looked and played. Didn't feel fun at all.
Jon A.	1	November 10, 2020	Failed to connect since the last 24hrs. Update: Game doesn't allow LTE connection, wifi only lol
Ian Johnson	1	November 10, 2020	"The game doesn't even load it stays on the title screen even with Wi-Fi and a ""new"" server, I've deleted and reinstalled it twice same deal just doesn't work."
chris wooddell	5	November 10, 2020	As on of the Great Gamer Gods I tell You this is DABEST! Its Like Archeage and Bless Had A Baby. Sugestion.. Completely disable / remove auto questing / auto battle. Regardless im blown away by the sheir awesomness.. Thank you and I LOVE YOU
Hye Jin Lara	1	November 10, 2020	I want to be an assassin but why only males can play that? Mages and priests are boring...and the game sooo slow its keeps blocking
RODGER	1	November 10, 2020	The game sucks. When you click on the objective, it automatically takes you the objective and finishes the following objectives for you. The most pointless part, is that you can manually clunckly move your character around. I've played mobile games before and this one is the worst. Stay away for your own sanity.
Omega Legends	1	November 10, 2020	The motion is so bad the ONLY thing good is graphics
Juraj Jumić	1	November 10, 2020	Could be better gameplay. Servers disconnect most of the time (EU1) which is frustrating. A lot of it is pay to win, although visually a pretty decent game.
Isabel Race	5	November 10, 2020	I I love love love it moooooooooooo much
Emmett Martin	1	November 10, 2020	I couldnt even get past making my character
Frost Adam	1	November 10, 2020	Worst game I've ever played. The screenshots are literally fake. The graphic sucks, the animation is non existent, gameplay is automated, and the fighting animation is nothing new except it's worst than others.
Kieron Craft	1	November 10, 2020	The game wouldn't work. I opened it and got nothing but a blue screen, complete waste of my time personally
Chris Barlow	1	November 10, 2020	Pretty, but pretty boring auto play. How much point is character making when you can barely see your character.
• Phantom	1	November 10, 2020	And another one gash grab game
John Nguyen	2	November 10, 2020	Lol. I downloaded and played once. It was bad, so i uninstalled. I didn't leave a rating, so i unintentionally downloaded and played it again. So bad, so so bad. Imagine clicking 1 square 3000 times. That's the game play.
Aly A	1	November 10, 2020	I was super hype for this game. I created my character on the very first NA server that came out. Got to level 65 before stepping away for the night to charge my phone. I come back today & I can't log in to my server anymore. Says my account doesn't exist and that the server is full *please choose a new server* ...why bother if my characters just gonna get deleted over night again.
David Carr	5	November 10, 2020	Cool
metalsnake27	3	November 10, 2020	Nothing special here. Pretty much a copy paste of every single chinese mmorpg so you already know what to expect. Entirely automated gameplay, too many systems that are just stat dumps, extreme pay to win, (tho I will say the prices are actually reasonable), and very janky gameplay. It has some good things. I like the auction house, the class variety, and the few dungeons I did were fun, but the whole game just doesn't feel right.
lakamokolaka	2	November 10, 2020	The game crashes and doesn't load half the time and when it does it lags more than a sloth in a riddlen factory. Despite it being a autoplayer game, it lags so much and it's only saving grace is its graphics and customization.
Rai Kazu	1	November 10, 2020	"Gender lock, Autoplay, p2w. I expected way more than this. It's just like any other mobile ""mmorpg"". Sad"
Dixciple Sage	1	November 10, 2020	This is literally black clover mobile but worse. And the classes are trash. And their should be gender change. Don't waste your time playing a game you don't get to play, it's all autoplay
Daniel Sheppard	5	November 10, 2020	Whys it keep disconnecting me from the game server for.
Pastel	1	November 10, 2020	Evidently this is another cash grab auto play. 😔
Steve Cleary	5	November 10, 2020	It is so fun killing
daiqua banks	1	November 10, 2020	Wouldn't let me use my mobile data to login i have to use wifi but I don't have any wifi
LookWhatICanDo	1	November 10, 2020	"ads were click bait, very disappointing. Why do you need to get the attention of someone (guys) by showing fake gameplay and that explicitly shows a women and the user being able to change bust size and looking awfully inappropriate? Objectification, especially towards women, is not right. I yearn for true gender equality, but clearly the developers do not. I imagine them just swiping aside the matter and not giving it a second thought besides ""this is good enough""."
kimjorich baysa	2	November 10, 2020	To lag...love to play the game..but its always disconnected..
Anthony Woolford	3	November 10, 2020	Game doesn't work so can't review
Emeraldluna Royals	2	November 10, 2020	Couldn't play the game when logging in.
Heso Yamu	1	November 10, 2020	Why it have daily level limit, it sucks
Jeulian Tony Ramos	2	November 10, 2020	The gameplay and combat is clunky and awkward and the voice acting is average at best. The graphics are above average but everything is so laggy that you barely notice the graphics
Jodi Coy	1	November 10, 2020	Poor stays a blue screen for over 20 min and doesnt do anything. Wont be installing it again. Or any games from this company. If I could do negative stars I would.
Samuel Wong	1	November 10, 2020	Same autoplay style game
Neil Garachico	5	November 10, 2020	I love this game, guys dowload this game you will never regret this game i swear.enjoy playing players godbless
Dark Cloud	4	November 10, 2020	"Only biggest problem is ""CLASS GENDER CAN'T BE CHANGE"""
Séverin Chailley	1	November 10, 2020	The character customization is great but the controls are horrible and the game plays on its own. Very lame
Catrina Mc Crindle-Van Winkle	5	November 10, 2020	Game keeps telling us to get to 60 on us server6 lvlcap is 59
Tyrone AlwaysReal	2	November 10, 2020	The character creation is nice but the game plays itself like im confused
Safron Morris	1	November 10, 2020	Everyone is talking about auto play but I didn't get that option. Ran around and fired some shots then deleted. I am fairly new to this type of game so no tutorial or in game support really sucked.
Bejhay Lachica	5	November 10, 2020	Ang dami nyong alam puro angal kung di maganda yung game 1 star faming nyong alam mga bobo naman pero sakin maganda yung game realistic yung game....
Corbin Kelnhofer	1	November 10, 2020	Went to login today and my account is gone. Sad, was planning on playing for a long time and spend some money on it. But now I think I'll just uninstall it.
Lucas Layton	1	November 10, 2020	Literally could not play the game for three entire days due to server queue on a MOBILE GAME. Unacceptable
ReXeFroz	2	November 10, 2020	Another boring game but whatever, the graphics is pretty good, but the gameplay is just like another common RPG, the auto, pet, rides, costume, wings, but it's really fun to costumize the character face.
It's Me	1	November 10, 2020	They delete negative reviews
David Spoon	5	November 10, 2020	Good
noobgod 50	5	November 10, 2020	ITS THE FIRST GAME THAT I HAVE LOVED
Lisa Hampton	1	November 10, 2020	It's Perfect World reskinned
matt knight	1	November 10, 2020	I've only downloaded the game and Its crashes or says I don't have connection but on my WiFi needs an bug update and sorted
Karl Angelo Pugay	5	November 10, 2020	I love it so much dis and fun I can play with my friends like black desert 🤩
Roehanth Rosanguil	1	November 10, 2020	"Fake ass chinese false advertising ""game"". It plays itself and worst, the company uses false ads to promote their ""game"". They use fake gameplay and sometimes steals other games footage. Why are you guys so horrible"
Justhavingfun xD	1	November 10, 2020	This makes me miss order and chaos the best mobile rpg.
King Ralph	5	November 10, 2020	LOVE GAME
Kevin Crooks	5	November 10, 2020	It really a good game
Romio raaj	5	November 10, 2020	Thank you
Wolfy Demon	5	November 10, 2020	I like it in all it is very realistic but THERE IS ONLY A MAN WARRIOR I AM A GIRL AND I WANT A GIRL WARRIOR AND ALSO PEOPLE ALSO WOULD LIKE IT IF THERE WAS A WAY WE COULD CHOOSE GENDERS anyways i am sorry for yelling but it is rude that i cant be a girl and also have a sword
Ayeehman Feudo	5	November 10, 2020	First of all thank to all developers of this game, you know what!? this game is awsome! Very easy to play, very easy to enhance all of your accessories, the mount upgrades are so givable and the gameplay is so soft, easy to level up, easy to join the events and guild. This MORPG is advisable to all starting players. It's only a couple of weeks since this game was started and I know the developers was trying to improve the game so calmly better to just be patiently wait for their updates.
moonlight_3045	2	November 10, 2020	Even when I do that it comes right back on
Fahad Kaabi	5	November 10, 2020	لازم تخلي لغة الجوال انجليزي عشان يشتغل 👍
mark monteverde	5	November 10, 2020	I love all of the game no issue download now 💛😊
J K	1	November 10, 2020	Server Distribution is terrible. Can't even access my character I have already put time into. Why whould anyone want to spend money on a character that they cannot even access.
Naffa Ridak	5	November 10, 2020	I like this game this game so good😊
Jordan Angelo Pulido	5	November 10, 2020	Its so good this is my fav game ever i play it so smooth and so cool i have new friendss now because of this thanks at this cool game😮💖
Prawnhub69	1	November 10, 2020	The auto play ruined the game but everything was perfect
Anthony Portelli	5	November 10, 2020	I rated this game because when I installed it and opened the app it just came a blue screen i tried to uninstall it and re installed it but it didn't work I hope this problem will be solved because I am very keen to play this game. Now I rate this 5 star because I restarted my device and it worked
Dioanna Esparal	5	November 10, 2020	I love this mmropg
anggi awan	1	November 10, 2020	the game is play by it self.
Shaun Murray	1	November 10, 2020	Auto play game. Graphics are the only thing good on this game.
ashley ortuoste	1	November 10, 2020	MAKE OTHER SERVER ON ASIA TOO MUCH POPULATION CANT GO IN ON THE SERVER ALWAYS QOUE
Sean Mahoney	2	November 10, 2020	Great graphics. But locking gender to class is dumb. Immediately uninstalled.
som88	1	November 10, 2020	For games like these, I just Skip story, then auto play, then uninstall the game.
Andrew Grenzebach	1	November 10, 2020	The game wont load as i join my character into the world it gets stuck at 32%
Rodolfo Rocha	5	November 10, 2020	Nice game
Dat Dang	1	November 10, 2020	The game claims to have unique character customization, yet the classes are genderlocked. Amazing.
Gone Mad	1	November 10, 2020	autoplay vip type game with bs story. graphics are good levels are basically given to you. pay to win. what a waste of my time.
Michael	5	November 10, 2020	Over fun and easy leveling and learning with the boys. It's just fun to play when you're depressed.
aeris ramos	5	November 10, 2020	its good
Amiee Cowley	4	November 10, 2020	Eh kinda good not that good but it's cool I guess but the tutorial I don't know what to do

Limberg Pasiona	1	November 10, 2020	Boring game...
Kami Kezo	1	November 10, 2020	Boring
MC Aykhan	2	November 10, 2020	When I open game, and press play, it doesn't starts! I can't even rate gameplay! Fix it please!!
Joel Tan	5	November 10, 2020	Nice cinematic cuts with slasher ESO feels. Could do with more girl chars
Sohail Saripada	1	November 10, 2020	Its keeps updating and the updating bar is not moving at all but its consuming a lot of data. What a waste of time for downloading and waste of internet data. smh
Mercyful Wolf	5	November 10, 2020	Fantastic game snd user friendly
RHEIGN AMORADO SISNORIO	5	November 10, 2020	Ask kolang this is online or not ?
Raihan Miah	1	November 10, 2020	Boring game tbh I mean its ok but just kind of boring not much to do tbh everything is auto.
Kean Gomon	2	November 10, 2020	All i can say is delete the autoplay and the game will be much better...
Kenard Kent Rana	5	November 10, 2020	This is a fun and addictive game.the graphics could use some tweaking but all and all are good!.i have some ideas for a update 1(make better graphics) 2( make a day and night cycle with snowfall and heavy rain) 3( make more characters)
Julian James	5	November 10, 2020	This so much fun UWU IWI👩😸
aina kawaii unicorn	5	November 10, 2020	Its awesome
Neb Ish	1	November 10, 2020	If you like to not play video games this is the one for you. Auto everything except gear upgrades. I cannot fathom the point of the player being there is no playing being done.
Roy Azroy	1	November 10, 2020	jangan download, game tak best.. 2 gb plak tu... asal log in je update sesaje.. buat abis data aku je... kuat makan data... terbang pun tak boley tinggi benteng pun tak boley lalu baik tak payah terbang... aptb.... nie bukan player control game.. nie game control player.. aduii
Don Jordy	2	November 10, 2020	Good game , but i cant get into Eu s1 bc its always full and if i try other server i must remake my char ....
anne proctor	4	November 10, 2020	Its quite good, the PvP is not a big thing in this with I really like. I kinda wish you could change the gender of your character cause I want to play as a female vampire, but thats more of just a personal want. My only real problem is the server level cal, I always keep hitting it and once I hit the level cap you don't get quests anymore, which isn't a bad thing honestly because I would hate to do the work involved and then not get the full quest output.
Charles Anderson	2	November 10, 2020	Don't let anyone fool you. This is an autoplay game. You can turn off autobattle in a fight, but it will be on again in the next fight. Quests auto complete, the best you get in terms of control is for quest wait for a prompt during dialog. It also lacks controller support so you know they aren't serious.
Sylicant JS	1	November 10, 2020	AUTOPLAY, enough said.
Kelly Hartman	1	November 10, 2020	Game crashes after character select. Reinstalled and still cant play at all.
Sidney H	4	November 10, 2020	Where are the players? im lvl 20 and havent seen anyone yet.
David Parker	1	November 10, 2020	It says to tap anywhere to enter game but can't enter game.
Johnfortich Vista	1	November 10, 2020	Server Connection Lost. Can't even create character. UNINSTALLED! WASTE OF TIME.
Jeffrey De Guzman	1	November 10, 2020	Always connection lost even if my net is okay
Elda Zotaj	5	November 10, 2020	I love it
Nick Puttock	4	November 10, 2020	Love this game, very smooth great graphics. Smooth, only negative is it looks like it goes up to level 400. Which seems a bit much. I would think having less levels but each level is more meaningful would be better. But i would say it is best and the best game of its type. No lag, no disconnects, currently level 66
Sarah Michelle	3	November 10, 2020	The game is nice with a few good events, but rather repetitive after a while. The soundtrack is beautiful and the guild events are nice. What ruined it for me was the p2w factor, the gap is huge. The players that spend money on the game have a clear advantage over non spending ones. The game really is nice but it stopped being enjoyable when paying players crush everyone else.
dark gaming kid	5	November 10, 2020	It's good the style and the other things look good
Wanie	1	November 11, 2020	TBH, I dont even know why most of the android mmoprg game developers are so much into autoplay games? If you really want to attract real gamers who would love to spend thousand hours and thousand bucks, stop making this type of game.
N	1	November 11, 2020	Can't even log back in after the first time I logged out because servers are full already.
Rich Whit	5	November 11, 2020	Great game. Superb graphics and playability.
Culture Man	1	November 11, 2020	Looks promising but, when I got into loading screen it's always kick me out from game, please fix this and I will edit my review
Seasee	1	November 11, 2020	Gender-based classes aren't fun as you cannot customize them. Hate mmo's with gender-based classes. Refuse to play them.
Lubu	2	November 11, 2020	Made a character and still unable to play since release
Everett Hazlett	2	November 11, 2020	It is a good game, can't turn off auto fight once it started. Lucky to play 5 minutes before having to reconnect to the server. Hard enough to get it to connect when starting the game. Had the early start on game, lost server 1 and can't get back in. It simply will not connect to server 1 and have lost my character. When it loads new quest, it locks up and goes to black screen.
Çürük raporlu klavye	1	November 11, 2020	boyle bir pay to win yok :) oyle boyle degil hemde... parayı veren düdügü calıyor. hatta o bile calamıyor cünkü oyun herseyi ama herseyi otomatik yapıyor, resmen oyundan izin alıyorsunuz birazda ben oyniyim diye :) tam keriz SİLKmelik
Debra Kelley	1	November 11, 2020	Game keeps crashing and giving a error code please fix your client wont allow me to log into the game it.crashes as i load character so sad this game used to be so great on pc
Zayar Wim	3	November 11, 2020	nice music and environment but please dont be pay to win too much
AnonymousLoki	1	November 11, 2020	"So how do we get COMPLETELY rid of the auto-play spec? I mean 100% rid of it? I tried to turn it off on commands, even looked to turn it off in the options menu. I dont want it in my gamplay, and I'm disgustingly sick and tired of it flicking back on, despite every attempt to turn it off & disable it. Its 2020, the auto-play spec is not only appalling and insulting unwanted. Its downright the mark of a trash game. So how can I get rid of it? COMPLETELY get rid of it? ""Play your way""? Thats a Lie"
Theo James Freeman	1	November 11, 2020	Cant do anything as cant get past level 59. Wake up and update the game befor u let people wast there data trying to play.
Phil Matcham	3	November 11, 2020	If I cant disable auto run I'll auto uninstall . What's the point of having auto ..might as well watch a film
Peachy_ Plays	3	November 11, 2020	The game itself is pretty good, the graphics and character selection is great. Only problem I have is the movement, when walking its not very realistic. Maybe if you could try making it a bit more graphic that would be great.
A random Memer Of Low Quality	3	November 11, 2020	Eh the whole thing is designed to get you to use the autoplay mechanics and wants you to not try and play it. The graphics are actually some of the best I've seen before on mobile and the character creation is pretty decent
Azz Office	5	November 11, 2020	Good game i like
jeremy johnson	5	November 11, 2020	I like it
Nara Tamng	4	November 11, 2020	Well the characters look very good and I love the map the dragon need to be bigger and but I still love it

Sadaf Azhar	1	November 11, 2020	Why does the game keep crashing and closing down?
Animux HM	1	November 11, 2020	Yea, cannot even load past the title screen. And I have a SG10..
Kimberly Shirey	2	November 11, 2020	It keeps kicking me out of the game every time I log in
Rick Pridnia	5	November 11, 2020	I see people complaining about auto play tells you fron the start you can turn it off im not having that issue All it takes is ti listen and read what it says lok
Velvet Barta	2	November 11, 2020	Great art...but game has to many glitches an keeps saying lost server even tho I know my connection is good,..it freezes as well an shuts off the phone....so this game being new needs alot of work on it,then I think it would be a good game, cause it has a good story line an graffics an plenty to do an you can choose if you want to auto or not..an loading is laggy also ..so if these things were fixed it would be a great game.
Glen Norton	5	November 11, 2020	Really like this game
JoAnn O'Brien	4	November 11, 2020	Great graphics and game play. A few bugs with the shop. Would get purchase error when buying with diamonds but item still ended up in my inventory. Great tutorials but I would fix the character design at the beginning since wheb you think of lip shape most people would not know it was in the makeup section. When I reinstalled the game it didn't have my previous character so I had to start from scratch without having my resources that i obtained from pre registration.
Robert Doucette	1	November 11, 2020	0 stars would be better (however we're not givnin' that option). A lame game that doesn't need me to play, so why does it want me to download you ask? access to my device and any cash i'm stupid enough to pay on it. no thanks, deleted...
Alessandro Flower	5	November 11, 2020	YOU CAN TURN OFF AUTOPLAY.. SO JUST DO IT AND ENJOY THE GAME
darer oon	4	November 11, 2020	Graphic good,not bad game.But if u want to be top players,u have to top up
Anthony Medina	1	November 11, 2020	Boring super fast leveling.. Server 9 max is 59 super boring nothing to do now

Aurora Bayes	1	November 11, 2020	I can't go in it
Eunice Angelica Agsan	5	November 11, 2020	This is a very good game
Le Pe	2	November 11, 2020	The Character editing is nice, However to easy to lol up also auto play button. I didn't enjoy it that much do to the fact that so much going on in the game half the time I didn't know what on earth was happening where to go what to do. Just not that great.
Rocky wolf	4	November 11, 2020	It would been a good game if I had space in my cell.
ASF 1010	5	November 11, 2020	Love this game!! I really dont know why people complain about the autoplay button cuz you can just turn it off. I really like this game so much!!❤ Thank you for making this game
Victor Acosta	1	November 11, 2020	This has the potential to be such an awesome game. The whole game just doing everything automatically, really ruins it. There is no fun in that, and no challenge, real games a person actually plays and gains rewards. Do the developers even play rpg's because you made what could be a great game, kinda suck. Sad, but I'm honestly probably going to delete it. This would be straight 5 star, unfortunately you've made a beautiful game terrible with all the auto play.
Jolie Lagman	2	November 11, 2020	Haven't even played the game. Gender locked classes stopped me in my tracks.
Shawn Davis	5	November 11, 2020	It's a great game
Saiful Rizla	1	November 11, 2020	Why this game when i start it is full of bugg!!!i delete this app. Huaaakkk why dev. U should do this game better
Cheong Jun Kai	4	November 11, 2020	I got a redeeem code for doing the survey but it says that the code is invalid.. But love the game
tanis hewitt	1	November 11, 2020	It's not downloading even after it reaches 100
Savage Life_420	5	November 11, 2020	Everything looks good but it want let me download the game bit it looks like a fun game as I said earlier. So yeah but if you think you will like it I think you should download the game. 110%
Venom 95	1	November 11, 2020	Minimum requirement ?
Hellcat Runner	1	November 11, 2020	This game is horrible. I would prefer going back to Blood Harvest despite it's age and enjoy it far more than this automatic game with barely any character customization and content compared to the original pc game that despite being almost 10 years old, is still a lot better than this in basically every way.
cati prado	1	November 11, 2020	It's annoying🤬
Fransiscus Xaverius	5	November 11, 2020	This game is awesome! You must to try!!!!!
Ladino Richardson	2	November 11, 2020	After character customization this damn game won't load past 32%. It's sucks. Can someone tell me what's wrong?
Nate Fanfan	5	November 11, 2020	Jesus Christ !!🙇🏾‍♂️🙏🏾
Casey Hardy	3	November 11, 2020	Full auto play... If thats your version of fun.
Aga Aditya Rahmat	5	November 11, 2020	Very good
Josh lopez	1	November 11, 2020	Was super excited to play this game but after I made my character, joined us-13 server ,then loading screen stops loading at 32% then the app crashes. Not sure if it my phone but I figured if I could play cod mobile on it this game should work fine.
drew 97 Pringle	5	November 11, 2020	the graphics are good but you need to make us play we have wifi
Louis Daniel Cayaban	2	November 11, 2020	Its a good game but its no laggy AND ITS SO SLOW DOWNLOADING IM ANGRY ITS SO LAGGY

MS Lazar	1	November 11, 2020	I was wondering how it will the game but unfortunately after installing the game is just a blue screen so I can't play. For me it's a sad experience because I really want to play it but yeah.. That's why I give 1 star

Ann D	5	November 11, 2020	I like the mage the caracters so relaxing thanks for sharing the game
Edwin Witron	1	November 11, 2020	Another autoplay game , come guys if you offer a mmorpg you need a open world with great missions, dungeons with raids , pvp etc stop to do autoplay games we play wow pc we expect something alse in android the effects and the grafics are really good but the game play and the autoplay game sucks
Clyde jomari Manilhig	5	November 11, 2020	So nice and cool graphics.. I like it a lot
elizabeth adams	5	November 11, 2020	This game is so fun and exciting
Chris Beeler	1	November 11, 2020	These Wi-Fi only, video gambling games have nothing interesting or impressive to offer,and I'm glad this flop never loaded after several attempts... simply awful as many have stated already.
Naza Naza	5	November 11, 2020	Game ni sangat karen sbb game ni ade filter dia mmg terboik lh....
Venomosity	1	November 11, 2020	Recharged during beta server, was given double what I recharged, which is great, but I have to recharge again in order to receive the first recharge rewards, and member. Also, received an exclusive title but when I went to my titles it wasn't there. You definitely should've left out the option for recharging during beta, if you simply have to recharge again in order to receive first recharge reward. I already submitted a ticket, no response.
Dwi Puji Rahayu	1	November 11, 2020	bad experience
Adrian Mejos	1	November 11, 2020	"I didn't play this game when I click the ""join the battle""button its back to my menu..😒"
gaming sad official channel	5	November 11, 2020	Best game to play
Michael Parker	1	November 11, 2020	Old school Forsaken World player. Was excited to see the mobile app, until i got to the character selection screen. Lazy port. All classes gender/race locked. Your options are reduced to human male warrior, human female wizard, kindred male assassin, kindred male vampire, elf female cleric, elf male ranger, dwarf female marksman. No elf bard, no stoneman protector. And to top it all, the number of 5 star fake ratings really weakens this game's standing.
Christina D	1	November 11, 2020	Another complete garbage pay-to-win with horrible gameplay, hard pass.
Kevin Nuñez	5	November 11, 2020	Enjoying it
Марко Радојичић	5	November 11, 2020	50000000000000/100 💯💯💯💯👑👑👑 best mmorpg game ever

mykha yt	5	November 11, 2020	This game is awsome
Michele	1	November 11, 2020	Boring,because it's all automatic and for this cause it's not engaging
Alex As	1	November 11, 2020	Misleading ads.
Luis Torres	4	November 11, 2020	Overall I like it, its pretty good the only reason i didn't give it 5 star is because after you reach lvl 61 it becomes overly difficult to gain exp the amount of exp u get from mobs doesnt help at all and in the other world where u just hunt monsters it also doesnt help very much. But again everytjing else is pretty good for a mobile game.
Julian Powell	1	November 11, 2020	Wheres the third person aspect of the game
Sinead Flynn	2	November 11, 2020	I would prefer it if I could have the option to play as a female character, than a male, I would juat prefer to play the game if I had that option considering I am female myself
Dominique Daniel Tjoa	1	November 11, 2020	Why why why this game when I enter it it's only show blue screen!!!! Pls fix this I really hate this game or should I say this game is trash!!!!!👎👎👎👎👎
Picasso Dynamite	1	November 11, 2020	Just another hurriedly made, auto controlled piece of trash designed to make fast money while keeping the biggest spenders at the top, looking good and doing nothing because auto-play does it all. In fact, you can't control this game because the mechanics are so bad you'll lose every time. It's made only to look good and cost alot. Genshin impact makes $245 million in the first month because it plays good and is a real game, this won't make $2 million in it's lifetime, think about it.
Qay Family	5	November 11, 2020	I LOVE THIS GAME THIS GAME IS COOL WOW
Angelito Gante	5	November 11, 2020	I love this game promise
Ara Rose	5	November 11, 2020	All systems Balance, Cool Heroes Amazing Skills. I'm so Excited on next Future Update. Make Balance always for not Quiting. Keep it Up.
Dem Wolf	5	November 11, 2020	I honestly don't care what people say this games pretty good from graphics to the storyline and to yall who hate the autoplay turn the dang autoplay off its not that hard! They worked very hard as you can tell atleast give them credit for this, they added the autoplay if you have to do something or you're just stuck and can't figure out where to go
Gerard Labadie	5	November 11, 2020	Great game friends, you will love it.
Miguel Samala	1	November 11, 2020	The graphics is so bad that an orange could do a push up! The task will finish themselves when you click on it how will the adventure be that good if its auto fight? Try harder
Ijustwant Usemytablet	2	November 11, 2020	Too much auto things. Autoplay autoquest autopathfinding, teleporting. You don't play, just watch. 31 lvl without feeling getting stronger or knowing locations.
Ashish Parmar	1	November 11, 2020	Amazing graphics but i was at level 50 and accidentally uninstall and i purchased some stuff and now i reinstall i dont see the character what is this???????
Josh Fonte	4	November 12, 2020	Gender-Locked Classes...

Alden Hampton	1	November 12, 2020	A waste of time
Robert Stratton	4	November 12, 2020	This game is amazing but it won't let me play the game using my data it only works when I'm connected to my wifi plz fix that
Ocean_ Lover4000	4	November 12, 2020	Only downside to the game is no gender switch i have no issues playing as a male being a female but the game is a bit sexist being that it is only male characters :/ so far from what I cam across. Which needs improvement big time. This is what is wrong with society, not accepting genders, especially in gaming and should have options to have different genders!!!
Jen Soto	3	November 12, 2020	Does my storage affect how this game runs? I cant even get passed character customization it's so slow and it keeps changing even when I didn't click it.
Sebastian Coeme	2	November 12, 2020	Not a bad game but there is a LOT of loading lag.. Needs some work on loading content.
Ian d Souza-bailey	1	November 12, 2020	The app won't allow me in keeps saying no connection
Kelysha Rodríguez	5	November 12, 2020	Love it
broken 15	1	November 12, 2020	Fake character creation ad
Snoozbear Reyes	3	November 12, 2020	It's ok, pretty much the same game like most of these mmorgs out. Was cool to have different types of classes tho.
Christine DiGiovanni	1	November 12, 2020	When I try to enter the game it only gets too 32% then kicks me off completely. Why can't I join the game I have reinstalled also 3 times. I was super excited to play and can't even enter the damn game.
Lea Verona	5	November 12, 2020	This game is great. Although it's too big but that's not a problem i'll install it if i have buy a laptop. A totally great game, i'm speechless.
Sasuke Ken	5	November 12, 2020	good ☆☆☆☆☆ Can you add: goblen or Goods or Devil
haziq adri	3	November 12, 2020	Well..tbh, this is one of the auto mmorpg game where u dont have to do anything and suddenly u get to the level 10....bruh, seriously, the tutorial is ok but too fast, the developer should make the game where the player need to do the quest by himself. Whats the point of mmorpg adventure genre if u dont have to do anything even walk to get the quest is auto. I suggest u give the player direction to the quest instead of autopilot the character to the quest.
Miran MoonRise	5	November 12, 2020	Nice games come here s7 sea , being friend with me guys🙏
Marcus _	1	November 12, 2020	Great graphics but sheer insanity to even contemplate on a PDA (with telecommunications) due to terrible control interface AND SCREEN SIZE! The greed of gaming companies is apparent with the rush to make PC/Console type games for a 'phone'. These games have very limited control/playability with LOTS of loot boxes, top-ups and memberships. If you're wasting your time (and money) playing games on a phone, you have no life.
Nathan Pautzke	5	November 12, 2020	It is so far a great game, and people on there, atleast my server are super friendly people
ITZ_ XXBLOODW4RXX	1	November 12, 2020	"I hate this game, every 2 seconds it tells me ""storage is full"" in game and you dont even play it just does everything for you"
Kitty OfDoom	5	November 12, 2020	I absolutely love this game! I had an annoyance with text limit, but they updated it today so I wanted to come in and give it 5 stars! To the people complaining that it's auto, well most MOBILE mmorpg games have autoplay, so that's not a valid reason to give a bad rating.
Chuyo Tasogare	1	November 12, 2020	2020 gender locked classes that is sexist,no excuse. I can't even MAKE a character because I can't even get into a server.If I can't make a male priest or male mage then this game isn't worth playing I'd rather play the original.
kyle St Clair	1	November 12, 2020	Auto genderlocks game. Visual novel mmo to not rpg.
Michelle Robertson	1	November 12, 2020	I would like to play this game but I cannot get it to load. After the initial opening of the developers names I get a navy blue screen that's blank. Then I have to close the app. What happened?
JAMAL SPARTAN	1	November 12, 2020	Noooooo why is this a TAP MMORPG. Stop making these hold hands game tap to go tap to do nonsense. No one is original anymore. Every game today has that AUTO QUEST nonsense. Nope I cant sorry.
MuHaMaD_HeNdRa_Official Hendra	5	November 12, 2020	5stars
梅梅	3	November 12, 2020	It's a cool game with nice graphic, but it's too much auto playing like the game just plays by itself, I could literally just cook noodles while it just play by itself. That wouldn't be fun. This game is also a bit laggy. If you're the type of person who would much rather enjoy playing the game yourself, I wouldn't recommend this for you.
Guertie Joseph	3	November 12, 2020	This the reason I put 3 stars because it's laggy and I can't start the game pls make it not laggy or I will put 1 star
andrewnette johnson	5	November 12, 2020	I love
Jhon Epps	5	November 12, 2020	Love this game so much fun
Sallie Zettervall	1	November 12, 2020	What happened to my game? Pretty bad. Can't keep the game on for over a day without deleting. I was a warrior. Now it will only allow me to be a silly little girl. This game socks big time
David Olshaski	3	November 12, 2020	autoplay non stop. great for mindless but not so great for thoughtful.

Nathan Phillips	1	November 12, 2020	Bro y people that create this game I feel bad just go throw your self into the trash bring your game with you it's awful I'm sorry but here's one reason y it's awful you can't change gender it lags it has so much glitches and my internet is perfect even even trust me on this I got out of my chair and went outside and checked my internet but this game is awful so delete it delete it hopefully you will definitely delete it.
Jordan Mckain	5	November 12, 2020	Thank u guys for best game ever Im so happy right now thanks i like the character development and everything
Joker Zero	1	November 12, 2020	I get to the login screen, it says it's loading then stops and repeat process.
Gaming WithTitanic	1	November 12, 2020	This game trash brooooooooo
Iuri Brandao	1	November 12, 2020	Just another auto-play mmo, one click to fast lvl up because that's what devs think we want. Still wondering how it went from 3.6 on ranking to 4.7 in a few hours but hopefully this treand drops quickly.
Reckoning Koas	3	November 12, 2020	I was a little bit hopeful for this one. But again every is auto, Automatically objective, automatically battles ect and the game holds your hand a bit too much that's just isn't for me personally. So I guess I move on to the next one.
beast mode	5	November 12, 2020	Wow
I_LOVE_MUSIC_	1	November 12, 2020	Literally a dogshit compared to previous version of Forsaken world autoplay p2w with a retarded Vip system with total recharge and spend ranks.buy Vip to get access to bosses to get gear like seriously?stay away from this cash grab garbage clone.you guys should be ashamed to call this game Forsaken World. Its more like Pay2Win Worlds.
Samantha Fernandez	1	November 12, 2020	I was waiting for this game before it even came out and when it came out I was going to play it and it as soon as I play it I finished creating my character and what happens next is as soon as I try and join a game it won't let me join a game so this was the biggest waste of time that I've ever tried waiting for a game I wish it would have worked so I feel very sad that this poor game that everyone happy got four stars but did not work for one person out of seven billion people and many others
Chris Cummings	1	November 12, 2020	Game is 100% pay to win. I am fine with supporting a game but when its pay to win then you get people with money to burn sitting at the top and noone has a chance, its no longer fun. One guy on my server spending 1k dollars and was around 300k power higher than the second place player. Thats not a game that promotes competition its just a money hog but what do you expect from a trash company like perfect world, all their games are like that.
Gabby Brubaker	1	November 12, 2020	It was super laggy i wouldnt playvthis game at all i only gave it a one star becuase i like how we can choose our character or whta we want to be and customize it but thats all😶
John Cesar Tanudra	5	November 12, 2020	Will recommend
Kimberly Murphy	1	November 12, 2020	Game will not open. Really wanted to give this game a try, but it just sits on a blue screen and never loads the game.
Alif Firdaus	5	November 12, 2020	good game !
Zet DeRoche	1	November 12, 2020	The Character Glitches with The Rogue so the Character will be always in the back of the Rogue every time I pick a character plus the game sucks because It has plenty glitches
Chelsea Wills	1	November 12, 2020	It was trash i vometed just looking at it to much glitchs i dont want to see this trash again
India Harwell	5	November 12, 2020	Moo moo
YearlongMoney 14	1	November 12, 2020	Its always blue
Egor Olender	1	November 12, 2020	Too much auto. No sandbox at all. Lvling up and gear find only from quest that you auto complete. You can have same experience from watching some low quality anime and it would be cheaper and more entertaining... watching ur char do everything for you for hours its just boring... ohh also its pay to win and doesn't require any skill to play at all. Zero stars!
Ryla Via Docil	2	November 12, 2020	When the game starts it's okay but when the character customization starts it crashes... what should i do?
Marita Torres	1	November 12, 2020	It doesn't sell good equipment, doesn't have gender change or enough character features, class choices suck, could be better view in combat so camera sucks to, pets are hedious and not cool looking at all, the only good thing are the boss fights.
Nao Rafkah	5	November 12, 2020	is super cool
Saleem Lucas	5	November 12, 2020	This game can go along way but you guys need to fix it up a bit it's still really finicky and the evolved forms of all of the classes are just down right horrible. This game has alot of potential do better.
Logan	5	November 12, 2020	A pleasant spin on the original mmo. Wonderful graphics (maxed on a note 20 ultra anyway), an eager community and a busy event schedule. Definitely worth a try even if you're unfamiliar with the name.
John Choate	1	November 12, 2020	Crashes instead of loading the game, making it unplayable.
Eonna Davis	3	November 12, 2020	Dude when I choose vampire I'm a dude can you at least change the genders so we can have multiple 0_0
Cleofe Hadsan	5	November 12, 2020	it is good like super Duper good
Ivy Graham	4	November 12, 2020	My total experience of this game has been so so. Partly because I had a guild from the get go to play with, but also because of all the things to do in the game. I thought events would get repetitive after a while, but for some reason, I really enjoy this. Grahpics are pleseant, I spent about 30 mins in character customization, I enjoy running around and unlocking hidden achievements and avatar/chat decals and crafting is fairly fun as well. Its not super pay to win as I first expected it to be
Benjamin Resnick	5	November 12, 2020	Good
LuciMatcha	1	November 12, 2020	Not horrible but kinda eh. Character customization is very limited and certain classes seem to be gender restricted. I just wanted to be a female vampire :(. The cutscene when you first open the game is very full life, it is a disappointment that the actual gameplay is pretty meh and the cutscenes lack life in terms of the characters. Game feels awkward and stiff. I'll just stick with only Genshin rn. I just want more good mmo's. Also the highest in app purchase is $300??,that's insane!
Rain Orion	1	November 12, 2020	"I got charged 3 times for the first recharge, did not get the crystals, did not get anything WHAT IS THIS TRASH?!? Refunded+uninstalled Graphics are MEH, the FPS wont go any higher dont waste your time on the settings. Gameplay is auto - not everyone's cup of tea but they pulled it off anyway, the characters have an ""ult"" that does insane amounts of damage that literally 1 shots anyone that doesn't top up a lot of $$ Connectivity is really bad constant disconnects from the server 1/5 trash."
carlo agtas	1	November 12, 2020	I thought it was a game, I'm not playing it, it's playing on her own. Auto objective is annoying
Naf Niñorogold	5	November 12, 2020	let see how much u got gamin hardcore
Yvonne Valerie Amparo	4	November 12, 2020	I'm so very rich here ;D
Gambit Martin	5	November 12, 2020	I give it 5 stars but I don't see the game cuz its so slow to download. -have a nice day to the owner
Adam Jensen	2	November 12, 2020	After the battle tutorial, you can just leave your phone and do something else irl, and it'll probably progress itself towards the end. I've been looking at the screen for full 5 minutes, watching my character, do quests on its own. If that's entertaining to you, then go ahead and install. But on the flipside, the character creation is diverse, so there's that. No body editing though, just the face, so it's quite lacking.
anon backup	5	November 12, 2020	ganda
Jacob Alseve Sera	5	November 12, 2020	all you have to do is customize your character and then explore the world isn't that cool
ferdinand tuliao	1	November 12, 2020	Real Buggy and real laggy and eeeewwwwww game
Тамара Ишимова	3	November 12, 2020	SO BRIGHT! It is hard to play really. There is something bad with lights and colors. Maybe it is on my part only 'cus I play thruogh BlueStacks.
John Marcel Perez	2	November 12, 2020	I dunno what it is about games that won't let me change the gender of my character in a set race, but I just can't give those games a chance lol rip
Jane Mary Molijon Caño	2	November 12, 2020	Its good coll grapich u know why i give this 2 star cust if i leave my accunt will restart agian
Demario Marshall	5	November 12, 2020	Best game ever best graphics
Surki	1	November 12, 2020	I get to create a character but it than proceeds to get stuck at 32% and wont let me play thats messed up
dave kerr	1	November 12, 2020	the game plays itself all you do is keep pressing continue, I had no clue what the story was, someone was asleep then they woke up, then I had a unicorn then I got some wings then I was in a city and got some amour. Who was I? What was I doing and why? Gave it a good 30 minutes, but this game is pants, I feel I was tricked into downloading it by it being a trending game. Boo! Edit: yes, you can turn auto play off but why bother? I wouldn't do a better job
Zidan Al Khafid	5	November 12, 2020	Nice game
Jonathan Webb	1	November 12, 2020	Strictly P2W, generic character design & advancement (wings, pets, mounts, etc). I know companies create these games to make money, but it's impossible to compete against so many players who can afford to drop hundreds of dollars or more for gear ten times more powerful than the best random item drop you've gotten. Graphics are nice, but don't bother playing if you don't plan on paying.
Mike Davis	2	November 12, 2020	Having to take pictures throughout the game, then having to share them on social media is too much. These are quests given to you in game. Game play is solid, as are the graphics, but take out the sharing of photos. Uninstalled because of the social media aspect sharing. Focus on game play and get rid of those photo quests.
Arsyad Fadhil Aqila	5	November 12, 2020	Iam like is game

Tinybird68 On insta	4	November 12, 2020	I think this game is great amzing graphics but it sucks that u cant fight u own beast it shouldnt only be quist anf i think that u should be able to build and level up items also it would be cool if u could do hunts for like demons or sum like dat

Shanne Mae Rosas	5	November 12, 2020	Maganda
- Kadii -	2	November 12, 2020	The game is really good. A lot better than most MMOS on phone. But after a few days you begin to realise its just like all the others. Recharge here and recharge there. Spend money to get this and spend money to get that. The server rush feature is just showing the people who are sinking unbelievable amounts of money into the game. And already the ones who can't afford that much are being left in the dirt. Shame, but I guess im uninstalling it.
Taufiq Fiq	5	November 12, 2020	Ok
Mudscamp	1	November 12, 2020	Raid is a turn based rpg done right. In case you’ve been living under a rock and haven’t heard, raid is a badass mobile game that changes everything. The game is crazy popular, with almost 15 million downloads in the last 6 months. Raid is an epic dark fantasy done right. A hero collecting turn based game with over 400 champions to collect and customize. In raid you can get knights orcs undead and more. Raid with friends in a clan, claim glory in the pvp arena.
Billmark Jacob Recto	5	November 12, 2020	love the game nice graphic's very free to play friendly also wide variety of character's the classes are great But i hope more advanced classes in future to keep the game more interesting and what a pet evolution feature that we'll more players invested in the games

Cycy Borgborg	5	November 13, 2020	Please put many channels in Lairs. Please.
Mel Kirkpatrick	1	November 13, 2020	Looked like a fun game, but everything just autoplays. Which sucks all the fun out of it. An option to opt out of autoplay would be great, since it feels like I'm watching someone else play a game, rather than getting to play myself.
Micah Pabalan	1	November 13, 2020	I hate this game why the game is crashes all the time

spider Weslse	5	November 13, 2020	Love the roles I'm using the rouge all of them look cool no mistakes at all the best game I played for mobile
Thomas Dominie	1	November 13, 2020	Auto play garbage. Nobody wants autoplay and the few that do aren't the main gamer audiences. Even the option to make the game autoplay is an instant Uninstaller for most. Stop making this trash and see how far a game goes. Developers take notes
SANDBOY 2	5	November 13, 2020	I like it open world can fly can ride dragon unicorn and can have pet 5 star the can i was looking for is here
Pridan Alava	4	November 13, 2020	It's a great game especially it's graphics but whenever I play it always tell me that I have no more space storage even though I have 64gb storage and I only used 22GB of it please fix this because it's often disturbing me play
cosmin alex	4	November 13, 2020	P2W game don't bother
Bo Griffin	4	November 13, 2020	auto-play rpg, pretty graphics. gender locked classes
Dane Starr	1	November 13, 2020	It's so annoying that I have to make another character again and start from the beginning. I can't access the character I made yesterday. The GAME DEVELOPER MUST implant the server on each character on the designated server SO THAT whenever the player returns he or she won't be bothered to create new character and start from the beginning!!! Now I have to uninstall the game and move on and find a BETTER one!!!
Wolf Wolf	5	November 13, 2020	I love this game so much, but it's lagging for me I love the details and the hair, I love this game so much it's so fun.
Gummy Bears	4	November 13, 2020	Good graphics and it keeps you going with the stuff you can get. What I don't like is that you can't choose gender for all the characters.
Ryder fraga	2	November 13, 2020	I would love to play this game, but crashes randomly when going through load screens and, or questing, device runs fine except cities, but that's expected.
Jacky	4	November 13, 2020	Decent game. Good graphics. A touch-and-auto quest type of idle RPG. I like the story and boss content. One thing to be mindful of is that there is a level cap that raises by a few levels every day, so everyone would mostly always be around the same level. It does keep you coming back to keep playing to unlock new content. Definitely not what I like, it's a preference.
Mipad 4	1	November 13, 2020	I cant even install it

adie 91	1	November 13, 2020	Noob server full,this game not good
Kiera Owens	1	November 13, 2020	The reason why I gave you one star because every time I try to get on the game it always takes me off of the game then when I try to get back on the game it always takes me off of it you need to fix your game right now and then I will fix my rate
Nitrozive	5	November 13, 2020	Great game.
cesaw70	2	November 13, 2020	No individual choices allowed after the game begins, the devs, as is usual with Asians, as well as offerings from GTArcade, refuse to explain things adequately and are dead set against you having control over your own play. They dictate what you will do, when and how you will do it. If you like being spoonfed and controlled, this one is for you.
Chris Esterly	5	November 13, 2020	Why can I only log into my server if I am connected to wi-fi? Game is fun but not being able to log in is extremely discouraging.

Edgy -_-	2	November 13, 2020	It's great and I love the graphics. The character customization is awesome but I can't make a character without the game saying I disconnected for no reason even tho my internet is good. I barely make a character with this disconnetion error so pls fix this and I will give you 5 stars later on and install this game
Latest episodes boruto	5	November 13, 2020	Love this game

Michael Bryan	4	November 13, 2020	Only been playing a couple of days... So far so good. There is quite a lot to contend with.. What with enhancing gear.. Pets.. Skills etc. Therefore the auto battle function is great as it allows you initially to concentrate on improving stats. You can turn auto battle off at anytime to take control of hero... Altogether really enjoyable so far
Cody Burtch	4	November 13, 2020	Amazing game but somehow lost my account
Muhammad syafiq Suhaimi	5	November 13, 2020	Played on pc and this game is my favourite game...The graphic is totally amazing and the gameplay was nice...Wish you could make 2 gender for all class bcs i would really loves to play mage char like in pc before...Really great game and dont let this game closed bcs you can make a lot of thing in the future in this game

Leslie Wild	4	November 13, 2020	I'm having fun, although its pay to win. So just enjoy it at your own pace. I'd enjoy it if they changed the bonfire guild quiz to another answering method (perhaps multiple choice). I find the 'in-chat' method is too difficult for my guildmates and they get very frustrated lol. Cheers

Anettcy Montoya	5	November 13, 2020	I love it. The only thing that makes me a little sad is some classes are gender lock. I think like mage, vampire, ranger, and gunner could be available for either gender it would be nice to have some more options for female class.

Lexer Zandro	3	November 13, 2020	im so excited to play this game bec i see the trailer and i thought its the same graphics but when i play it its not like that the graphics is looks like western mmorpg and this is not really open world coz you can fly but it has a limit and also i try to swim but its not you can walk under the water and also the same with the map it has a limit and also the controller its a little bit laggy make it true open world that you fly anywhere you want and you can explore the whole world .

Mudd Cup	5	November 13, 2020	Beautiful game with some exciting things others dont offer. I love the character customizations as well as the huge selection of class choices. There are quite a few disconnects and areas of the view seem to black out from time to time but overall it's one of the best games I've ever played.
antonio masaga	5	November 13, 2020	Very cool..

Realy jeuz Atienza	5	November 14, 2020	nice game
Timothy Covar	4	November 14, 2020	I love this game. It's fun an I'm learning something new just about everyday. The grind is so rough though. The drop rate of gear is not so good. Even trying to craft items, the drop rate of anything beyond rare is to low as a % to the player, so that's my only complaint so far. Other than that it's a very nice visually yummy AMORPG. 👍
Ejen Din's	5	November 14, 2020	Always a good thing to have a look at the game on...👍👍
Sam Ledoux	5	November 14, 2020	great game

Walter Wilson	5	November 14, 2020	👍
lu na	5	November 14, 2020	I started playing this game 3days ago and it's fun, I'm enjoying it because I didn't expect a lot the game is new and there will a lot of things to be improved (the map, flying..) But still it's fun and doesn't need a lot of Data which is cool (this week my wifi was so slow) and its kind remember me of perfect world. Keep the good work!
Clyde Wideman	5	November 14, 2020	Nice graphics and eazy game play
Fieona Ross	1	November 14, 2020	I liked the game at first. There is an activity calculator on the guilds, I can't for the life of me figure out how to gain activity. The first time I had my guild, there were 15 of us that were on constantly and got our guild to #3 of reputation in the server, we even won both our guild wars we did. 1 day later I log in to a message stating our guild was forcefully disbanded by the system because we were inactive. Fix this and my stars go up in rating! I have SS documentation of our activities.

Jackson Darcus	5	November 14, 2020	"Why 5 stars? Cuz it does exactly what I need it to do. I know some complained ""1-click"" and watch. But for those of us who work all day and take care of kids at night its nice to have a great looking game with English voices to play in the background. Something to look up every once and a while to see some cool animations and/or a win. Click again and move on with your day. For those of you who want a none auto/idle game, go for it (Honkai Impact is amazing), but this game fits my life perfectly"
Jehu Feliciano	5	November 14, 2020	Cant connect to server everytime I am logging in. You should at least indicate on the home page that a maintenance is on-going or not so players may have an idea what is happening.
Aldrin Arosco	5	November 14, 2020	Cool and Wonderful
Claire Rogerson	3	November 14, 2020	It's a good game but I would love it if you could choose the genders, that would make the game so much better.

SaNjiB Das	5	November 14, 2020	Sanj
Anbrille 09	1	November 14, 2020	If you are looking for something that can be skipped and go thru without even paying a lil bit attention on the game or the story, it's for you. It's like a click and point game. Worst.
Andre Michael Pietroschek	5	November 14, 2020	A wonderful show of potential, with ill-timed pop-ups and too much micromanagement spoiling the story and player freedom. Nice we can actually fly with our wings, sad we cannot hide them from view. I liked testing a rogueto level 80, and a priestess to level 60. Server connection had more issues on early servers (Europe at least).
Greg Mayes	5	November 14, 2020	Awesome

Ginyu DB247	1	November 14, 2020	Pre-registration was a joke. Nothing Good to say about this game and devs either. The 5mstar reviews are just people the dev gifted ingame packs to for the review.

erica bishop	5	November 14, 2020	Good game

Cuong Pham	5	November 14, 2020	I love the game so far. The only thing is that the server I play is full when I log back on. I choose to go to different server how can I continue with my character? I don't want to start a new game my character lo 85

Kornel Kuczynski	4	November 14, 2020	The ting is that this game is very laggy and it takes 6 second for the character or the loding screen to move and the grafics need some improvemen.

Twonk Donk	1	November 14, 2020	who gave this 5 stars?? haha... 4.6 stars has to be false..... if you have a job this isn't for you, if you don't you can't afford it.... decent graphics, great character customisation, PVE and PVP no difference unless whales are battling and i was an early server whale.... had high hopes but no, sorry, move on swiftly
Erica Ballard	5	November 14, 2020	One of the very better RPG. Graphics are awesome. Easy to understand and complete quests. Doesn't require money to upgrade or advance. By far... my favorite game.

Rhea-Michelle Isaac	3	November 14, 2020	Fun game, graphics are okay, gameplay is okay aswell but gives off p2w vibes. Auto battle can be turned on or off and I love that feature because I can do dungeons with my friends whilst watching a show and not have to worry about anything. The server I'm on, the community is friendly. My only issue is, when I signed up with guest ,I couldn't link my account.
Wiliandra Jun	5	November 14, 2020	"PLEASE keep continue your game system like this and give more event for next gameplay with team, especially for free player. My first impression to this game is good to play, there still way to get paid 💎 and the bound one is constantly rewarded. So far I'm enjoying the game since even not become a ""money""-player my power still following the highest with more efforts. AND dear developer, can you make less unnecessary word become censored 😅 communication is key to play for me. THANKS!"

christian salamanca	4	November 14, 2020	very nice game👌
Big Mike	5	November 14, 2020	Okay so after playing it a little more, here is the final verdict. Overall, better than the original and highly addictive. Good in every way. The problem is the energy system and the many ways you are gated from PLAYING which is the whole point of a game. Look you have a great game on your hands and it is a shame it is so held back by as many restrictions put on it. 4/10.

Khadija Rajab	1	November 14, 2020	I couldn't even load the game the second time I decided to play, the first time I made my character (The character freedom is pretty good). I'm looking at the reviews and I guess this game is just not it. Genshin is better, the game is too rushed and it's probably has autorun like all the other ones.

Md Sahil	2	November 14, 2020	Graphic is good but disappointed gameplay
Echo Thunder	2	November 14, 2020	I would say it's good. I loved the graphics, background, design, character and animal designs too. The 3D experience gives excitements to players of course. But the game's downfall was sometimes in order to purchase something, we need money.
David DeJesus	4	November 14, 2020	Alot going on..but I like it so far..give me some more time with the new updated game.

Ryan Pilah	5	November 14, 2020	Cool
Kage Gēmā	2	November 14, 2020	Almost every single thing about this game is great. Only two thing I believe should be brought up. And; I bet most of the people who play the game will most likely agree. FIRST; All classes at the character selection should be both sexes of female and male. SECOND; The guild creation should be open to all players. Shouldn't be to those who can afford soul gems. Or; pay to play members. If you really want to think about it. It's really unfair to those who can't afford to pay. So; I rate it 2 star
Joel Luluquisin	5	November 14, 2020	nice graphics..

Give me time to play and let me decide if I want to rate it don't force me to, so for now you can have only 3 stars that can either be added to or subtracted from!
LethaLee Fox	1	November 14, 2020	Attempted to load, got to character creation, but couldn't complete that, using a Samsung tab A 32 gig device memory. The game kept freezing or crashing... did not get to a save point... thinking uninstalling would waste less time.

Jayde Weythman	3	October 29, 2020	I really do like this game. Its perfect for passing time. I just wish there were times when you could design your own pencils and pick which tools you can use, instead of always designing what you guys have picked out.

William Huntley	2	October 29, 2020	Addictive but an ad after every carve is annoying
Jessica Ashton	2	October 29, 2020	You can only do one pencil and that's it I've un locked a lot a them as well and I can't play so only 2 stars for now.
V0IDWALK3R 1563	3	October 29, 2020	It's a really good time waster! And not in a bad way. But anyway it's actually alright and quite good. I wish they'd add more functions tho. Such as more colors or more of a variety. And other than that it's pretty ok!

Kendall Sopfe	1	October 31, 2020	I do not have one couse it wont install. :(
Shitlins Bennett	4	October 31, 2020	Pretty good game. My only drawback is that at the start of every level it tries to force you to buy a new pencil. Not a bad thing, just annoying.
Kameryn Demma	3	October 31, 2020	The names and colors of the food are kinda weird. First a green banana, never seen one of those unless it wasn't ripe. A leamom I understand that it is a typo, which makes me think that this was really rushed. Then a orange pineapple, pineapples are normally a dark yellow.
Ewa Butt	4	October 31, 2020	I like it. It just doesn't let you pick out what we want, I don't care about the ads.

Eduardo Cruz	1	October 31, 2020	If there is the tiniest bit left to carve you have to do it your self and it ruins it. It should be like other games so that if there is the tiniest bit left to carve it does it by its self.

The game itself is 5 stars it is very good runs smoothly and is interesting and fun but the ads are just too frequent. I really understand why there is ads but they are way to frequent. Maybe let us have two levels then a ad not a ad after every level or every time you need to redo a level. Don't get me wrong though it is fun and I look forward to seeing more games from you.

Liv Michael	2	November 7, 2020	It's oddly satisfying but I dont like it makes you do specific things doesn't let you be creative.
Alexandra Carrick	3	November 7, 2020	Okay so don't get me wrong it's a good app and very relaxing but you eventually run out of coins and can't buy the pencil you have to carve as they get more expensive and they only give you like 250 coins for each one you carve so by the time your on level 4 and the pencils cost 1000 coins you can only buy the first two or three

Keilah Cruz	5	November 8, 2020	It is a great game and I know that it's not my game but It would be fun if you added missions 😁
MIKE STEIN	5	November 8, 2020	So far so good, lots of interpretation between games, with you guessed it more game ads. Its free so I guess it should be expected. Would be better if purchased and zero ads.

Ian Wright	1	November 9, 2020	BOOOOOOR-RRRIINNNG!!! Really... what is the POINT of this (so called) game.? Well, ok, you carve cylindrical shapes out of pencils on a lathe but all it does is test your ability to move your finger up and down. Seriously, don't waste your time, your effort, and ESPECIALLY not any money on this junk. If I could give it zero stars then I would.
Leo Payton	2	November 9, 2020	To many ads
Ebony Marks	1	November 9, 2020	Lose my place in pencils
Zoe Smith	5	November 9, 2020	This is a really cute and satisfying game to play
Gregg Currie	2	November 9, 2020	I gave 2 stars because even though it's kind of fun. To get to the good stuff is just to far off. What you see on the picture will take a long time to reach. They'll make their money if you get there. But you'll get bored.
Kaily Reyes	5	November 9, 2020	This game is fantastic, and I beat all the levels in a day with how addicting It is. Even then, I went back to play them all again the next day. Then I deleted it yesterday, but couldn't find another game like this one. This game is great.
Lindsay Schwartz	1	November 9, 2020	I payed for no ads and am still getting ads. It's a rip off and sucks.

Jordan Thompson	1	November 9, 2020	TOO MANY ADS! There is a ridiculous amount! One after every level... I get the game developers have to eat and earn money. But seriously?? This is too much. Fun game but would give less than 1 star if possible due to ads.

The Radio	1	November 9, 2020	Multiple Ads literally after every round GARBAGE Ads are a joke #WasteOfTime
cheery berry	4	November 9, 2020	Cool
Darren Maggs	1	November 9, 2020	Any app that has way too frequent ads is an automatic one star for me. Literally after every round you have to sit through a minimum of a 5 second ad, and most of the time you have to manually skip the ad or sit there for 30 seconds. There is no need for this level of frequency and just proves that this was written purely as a cash-grab rather than a genuine game.
Colin Malone	2	November 10, 2020	Way to many ads i have to watch an add to do anything in this game.
Larki Punjaban	5	November 10, 2020	It is lovly game it,s good game

Use : CASHPIRATE App - Get IOK DoIIar	5	November 11, 2020	This a game which passes your time quite fast as it does not gets boring at all. However there are some problems which the game needs to fix. Some of them are :- 1)Pay to win - This probably is the biggest problem right now in the game. 2)Glitches and Bugs - Please fix it. 3)Ping Problem - People are losing their rank due to this. 4)Matchmaking - It seriously takes a lot of time if you have higher rank. Otherwise in my opinion this is the best game in the world!

Dotryfruit	1	November 13, 2020	For one, this game is pretty boring. There's not much to do, and not much room for creativity. And, there's an add every fricking 5 seconds. I'm uninstalling. Dont download this app. It's terrible, I would rate it 0 if I could.
Paige Ward	4	November 13, 2020	It's okay but it tends to lag
Paramjeet Sidhu	5	November 13, 2020	Nice 👌
Ink Fan	4	November 13, 2020	Honestly really fun and relaxing! I find myself playing constantly. The sound effects are nice, the vibration is satisfying, and generally, the sculptures do look like what they're supposed to! But I wish there was a mode where you can make what you wish. That'd allow for so much more creativity!

Greg Price	1	November 1, 2020	Do not like the one round games. The ad after every game is more than annoying. I do not think the developer knows the rules to cornhole. If a bag bounces off the ground onto the board, it should not count as a point.

Christopher Marsh	5	November 5, 2020	👍
Progress Gaming	3	November 5, 2020	Kind of lame and too easy but, enough of a game to kill a few minutes when you need too. Of course lots of ads but that's how we get free games to play. Overall, it's ok but not very challenging not to mention repetitive.

Work Out	1	November 13, 2020	No matter what or where I tap on the main screen nothing happens. Can't play it
jashawn Holmes	5	November 13, 2020	Love game when it's boring in house
Cyn Rogalski	4	November 13, 2020	It's a good game. Easy to play, quick rounds. I did pay for no ads, which is well worth it, for me. My only criticism is the sensitivity to the finger used to launch the beanbag is not consistent. However, this is not brain surgery, so it's not that big a deal, but worth mentioning.
Gary Swieczkowski	5	November 13, 2020	Enjoy this game!!!!!
Ray Lukasik	5	November 13, 2020	Decent game. Fun to play
Jose Cruz	5	November 13, 2020	love making those hole in ones
Matt Humphries	5	November 13, 2020	This game is a great time killer, yes it's easier than most I have played like this, but if you're just killing time it's fun. If you don't have latest version of OS on you'r android or apple device you will experience problems loading the videos to receive rewards.

Michael Martin	2	November 14, 2020	Way too many ads
Melissa Leedy	1	November 14, 2020	Is the game just ads? Or is there a game to play? Hard to rate controls or game play when you're watching ads more than you're playing the game. So disappointing, this could be a really fun game.
Kevin H	5	November 14, 2020	I like it it's almost like playing horse shoes

Rodrigo Espelita	1	November 11, 2020	Dissaponted. Back to V4 global. You habe a crappy grphics compare to black desert and V4 but your game demands a high end phone. Your devs sucks. Or play from mid to low settings.

Sibani Naik	5	November 11, 2020	Very nice game
Logan	1	November 11, 2020	Nothing special. Another auto-battler money pit. What else did you expect from netmarble? I'm only here because I saw it was #2 top free and almost blew chunks. Just goes to show how starved we are for something new n' tasty on mobile.
Naung Ye' Oo	5	November 11, 2020	I found a lots of improvement required. But game play and ideas are pretty great. Bug: Sound goes pretty aweful after an overlay app came up. I used in game payment via google pay and then sound goes aweful. Required to restart. Then again after answer incoming call. Suggest 1: Please add an in-game support chat system for support, feedback and suggestions. So no one will mess on your playstore app feedback. Suggest 2: Please add a feature which use both network of Mobile data and wifi.
Francis SirLancealot	5	November 11, 2020	great game!!!
Spidey dork124	3	November 11, 2020	Its a great game considering its a mobile game, but i keep getting internet connection errors which ahouldnt be happening because my internet is fine and im using a recommended server. I keep having to redo a quest 3 or 4 times before it actually gets completed, this takes away from the fun of the game and makes it more tedious but if this gets fixed, i'll change it to 5 star because its generally a great game

Adrian Roberts	2	November 11, 2020	Having connectivity issues.. It keeps disconnecting me every minute or 2 unless this game needs 500 mbps internet speed then my 400 definitely won't do.. The game looks good but I'm not playing it until this connectivity issue is fixed
Gherca Emanuel	2	November 11, 2020	As soon I discovered Auto play button I uninstalled the game I don't understand the reason for that function Thank you but this kind of game is not for me

Steven Wade	5	November 11, 2020	It seems like a real good game so far, not much time in will update later.
Josh St. Charles	1	November 11, 2020	The battle royale is pretty boring. Why there is only a small circle of light around you to see enemies makes no sense. You choose new temporary weapons in pvp for no reason, making your class choice pointless. Auto play but not in pvp which is very cool. Graphics are fantastic. I only play pvp games I was really excited but this pvp is clunky (stand and cast) and boring. May be P2W later idk.
Tiffany Casanas	4	November 11, 2020	I started playing the game as soon as it came out at 1AM, and from what I've seen it's mostly just an auto-battle game. The graphics and cinematic are AMAZING, and the story line is good too though. The control are okay but kind of sensitive.
TECHNO GAMES	4	November 11, 2020	nice

Clark Liu	1	November 11, 2020	Totally pay to win, soulinker is importent for increasing CP, you earn blue diamon in game, can summon second tier soulinkers, but top tier soulinker can only be summoned by paying real money. AND the game itself is another auto quest and auto fight game, just like others, only more money driven.
Malkeet Singh	5	November 11, 2020	India best best best game
Kevin Lehoux	5	November 11, 2020	so far so good, some auto quests can be slowed to claim rewards from previous quests but overall the pace and controls of the game are really good!
harshit sultania	5	November 11, 2020	I was looking forward for this kind of game. Glad it came.
Mr. Shivraj	3	November 11, 2020	3 stars cuz, don't get me wrong, it has great controls, equipment and all but, some times the npc say something else and the subtitles are something else and I don't like the graphics that much according to the storage it takes which is 2 GB, U can clearly see the pixels in the game so........ 3 stars, other then that everything else is great............ This was my honest review.................

Dragon of Frost	5	November 11, 2020	I like the game but I would kinda like it if you can lock soul linkers as well as be able to evolve the 1-3 star linkers. The first thing I would want is because I am weird and like to have one of each this and the second thing is just because it would help get the codex for them complete a bit faster.
Syed Salman	5	November 11, 2020	supeerr
Jake Starr	1	November 11, 2020	Crashes more than ppl on sleeping pills. 99% auto-play and is highly disappointing. The bulk of the game is pay2win and costs outrageous crackhead money. All in all its a typical piece of trash Chinese made game that's extremely overpriced. Don't expect much.

Khushboo Singh	5	November 11, 2020	Very BAD GAME BUT GOOD
Abhishek Kumar	1	November 11, 2020	Uninstalled. After constantly playing for 1 day. It's another auto play game you just watch it & just do few taps every few mins (won't even have to do that with vpn). I actually put the game in floating window & watched animes chatted with friends because my character doesn't need me to play. Seriously they create a detailed story line then ruin it with auto play & level rush rewards (only limited players get high tier equipments if i focus & read the story i will fall behind in levels)
Mateusz Zieba	2	November 11, 2020	Installed, played and uninstalled. I don't understand what's the point of having or playing a game that runs itself? What's the point? Switch it on and look at the screen? You could just play videos on yt and it would be the same. Absolute shambles

Devier	1	November 11, 2020	Ok , you could have made it better Pros : 1. The learning curve is big 2. There's a lot to explore ( not sure thou ) 3. Concept of battleroyale is really good 4. Controls are good Cons : 1. UI is too complex to understand 2. Autoplay system 3. Game breaking Bugs 4. Constantly disconnecting from server 5. Bad optimization 6. Voice acting 7. Tooo much texts makes it boring already 8. Story mode isn't intresting at all And more more more ....

Miles St.Peter	1	November 11, 2020	Was excited for this game but its ruined by autoplay,. If I wanted to watch th3 game play itself I'd go watch gamers on twitch. You can't even turn it off. Well you can, but then it pops back on after a kill. Autoplay is garbage feature in mobile games. Just garbage.

airanat jarurojparkoyrn	1	November 11, 2020	Dear A3 creators I play this game in samsung s20. This game is very jerk. At first time I thought because the resolution and graphic was high but when I changed to low quality it was jerk like high quality. I like this game. Please fix it. Thank you
Burak Akbuğday	1	November 11, 2020	Pay2win autoplay game. BDO clone. Riddled with popups to buy stuff. And servers are unstable you randomly get disconnected. Stay away. And don't bother with generic reply.
Gamer Ezzz	1	November 11, 2020	Nice graphics. However, uninstalled due to poor server maintenance. Constant disconnect on server hops.
Rogerio S. Campos	4	November 11, 2020	Love the game, my feedback is only that you guys need to make some affordable monthly packs including all the basics for people who can't spend much money. Stadia, Xbox, PS, Steam offer a crazy amount of benefits for £10 a month. Make worth our money and you always going to have players.
Dennis Lintern	1	November 11, 2020	I have the game installed, when I start it on my phone it starts to loads then crashes. Reload the game and het the same issues again. Uninstalled, reinstalled and it still crashes. Cleared my cache etc too and it still crashes...

Fernando López	3	November 11, 2020	Un juego más... El juego puede tener una historia interesante pero la jugabilidad se vuelve realmente repetitiva y aburrida, creía que revolucionaria como WOW pero el multijugador es uno casi falso ya que lo que los demás hagan no influye mucho en ti, esté juego tristemente será uno más del montón si no agregan algo inovador en este tipo de juegos.

Dimas Kurniawan	2	November 11, 2020	I'm with my highest bandwidth right now but get disconnected too many times. I disconnected more than I played.
metalsnake27	4	November 11, 2020	This game surprised me. I'm honestly surprised how focused it feels in terms of its systems and overall gameplay. Everything feels really solid and easy to understand, rather than being overwhelmed with things that are just slapped on for good measure, and the soul linker system is really cool with the fact that they have activatable skills and what not. The BR mode is fun also. It is a bit grindy, but it's not as bad as some other games. Overall, I enjoy it a lot.

Alex Matt	4	November 11, 2020	I rate 4 stars for graphics, it's high quality, and it's hard to sculpt like that, i downloaded this game by saw trailer, but compared to trailer, game play is top view, and hard to control. And often it showing me server error, that you're disconnected from server, but my connection is good. I thought it is 3rd person view game. But it's simple anyway, again i say the models are amazing. Realistic. Hope you fix that error

Drew Ricfort	3	November 11, 2020	The graphic is great! And I like the zoom out feature of the game, it feels like I'm playing that cool rpg on PC thru mobile phone. However, the skills seem not that really good visually. Maybe rework on more skill branches, and wider skill effects with realistic skill effects like those ones in Marvel Future Fight character skills then this will be overall a great job, you will beat the rest of RPG games out there 😊 👍
NitroCorn	1	November 11, 2020	"WHY? I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY? This game has ""Auto Battle"".. I'm beyond disappointed as I've waited many many months for this games release and the first thing I see is Auto Battle. It ruins the experience, and this simple feature is why MMORPG's are a joke to Console & PC gamers. You just lost what would have been a very deep pocketed loyal player."

Sounak Guha	2	November 12, 2020	Why auto-gameplay?
Tishyo Saha	2	November 12, 2020	This game is just an auto battler, just like most of the other MMORPG games on mobile. If you're looking for a good MMORPG for mobile, go for Black Desert Mobile instead. It's an auto battler too, but it's way better than this one, runs better than this one and has better graphics too.
Aan Prasetia	3	November 12, 2020	great but not good enough.. the graphic is great, story line is decent, and the skill preview is good enough. But the game it self doesn't supporting full view(can't rotate the player view) n when you wanna open menu, it's too cramped n hard to remember. Need some adjustment or am i missing some in settings.
elyga justkill	1	November 12, 2020	Devs delete my review...
Malay M.	1	November 12, 2020	Why over complicate it with all the parties, upgrades, loot boxes. Keep a single story mode with upgradable weapons and its more than enough to hook everyone up with it
Yashu Goyal	1	November 12, 2020	I download this game to play but I see it needs more upgrade of aboute 2.4 gb by which I m unable to play this game . Very said .. You should mention the real size of this game already or start it with that size don't do In game upgrade . I m so disappointed
Eagle eye	2	November 12, 2020	There is battle sound effect glitch , i mean there is no sound effect of hitting target or anyting like that please pix this problem then i can rate more.
Soukat Basyani	5	November 12, 2020	Really loved it!!!! I was waiting for a very long time to play a game like this one and finally I am able to. For past several years I haunted every website and youtube channel in search of a rpg game that won't be too complex, yet it has to be a good storyline as well as charecter development. And not to mention that I tried a few game before like Dragon Raja, Onmoyji etc but never made my mind to stick with that and spent my precious time. But in this one...I am going to.

Kyle Brown	5	November 12, 2020	fun to play and it has amazing animations
Delores George	5	November 12, 2020	sweet game
akshay kumar	1	November 12, 2020	Netmarble is so greed company,it needs only money
Johnny Web Johansson	1	November 12, 2020	Good graphics. Garbage animations. 3d game but why can't I rotate the camera? Is this like a glorified 2D idle tapper? Screenshake isn't smooth and the game just spams it in every attack you make, I know you can disable it but man screen shake is one of the worst I have ever seen. Auto-pathing is welcome but I prefer I tap the quest objective when I want to autopath. I'd rather put up with Genshin Impact's resin issue than to mindlessly tap my screen repeatedly so the game keeps playing itself
Luke Hart	1	November 12, 2020	Needs a LOT of work. Having world bosses spawn in open world and not a dungeon? Bad move, boss doesn't even last 30 seconds, so most people miss out. The Battle Royale mode is a great idea, but poorly executed. There are plenty of other MMORPGs in the Play Store that are MUCH better.

Prashant jawale	2	November 12, 2020	Why server are getting disconnect after few second Cant play the game properly 😟
sportsquid	1	November 12, 2020	I have no problem with autoplay games. It means I can get other things done while having a bit of fun on the side. So that is not my gripe with this game. The problem is there are already so many similar, better games on the market. Character customization is poor and all the features are the same or stripped down versions of systems in other games.
SpiritWalker GG	5	November 12, 2020	Cool game but pls make it so you dont have to sign up after you download everything to the game I know its only bc its a new game but still i would really love to try it out other than that keep up the good work and i hope to play it one day :)
sunil kumar	5	November 12, 2020	Ssssss
TOXIFY THE PHARAOH	3	November 12, 2020	Its a fun game its mostly automatic upgrades to character is a bit confusing they also have a battle pass and you can do pvp, its kind of like paladin or other games were you hunt creatures and fight other players to win the objective, not a bad rpg leveling up is kinda slow and when you upgrade your gear the higher you get you have a higher chance of nicking it back down a few levels
Melvin Charayap	5	November 12, 2020	For me The game is perfect.. because you can fix your stats that can defeat high cp.. so i give 5 star for the game..
Sagar Kumar	4	November 12, 2020	It is good 👍
logan Sydor	5	November 12, 2020	I got nothing to day other than the game is really great

Gabriel Naranjo	5	November 12, 2020	I am hooked I want to play this game for a while until Diablo immortal comes out I was looking for a filler and this is it
Dhayle Soriano	3	November 12, 2020	Graphics is nice.But, i don't like the characters animation, it's like a robot if you ask me.
Kyle Tibbetts	5	November 12, 2020	So far so good, but an auto transfer of upgraded equipment to newly equipped would be nice. Maybe ask on a pop up if you'd like to transfer at a price?
Ayush Guleria	1	November 12, 2020	It's a trash 🗑️ not worth of your time
sarita kamra	5	November 12, 2020	I just can't equip soul linker and also I don't know how to! So please provide it too! :( I had to make a new account to do it all again 😬. But it's a great game
Zedrhix Garcia	3	November 12, 2020	Its a nice game for me. But 2d gameplay cant rotate the cam i think its much better if you make this game 360 view.
Aditi Sharma	2	November 12, 2020	I not getting confirmation code for my reserved name what to do . I have tried multiple times as well as with different log in type but still same issue.
Raymund Belleza	5	November 12, 2020	awesome game! Love the gameplay! Fantastic experience!
karan bhatt	3	November 12, 2020	This is good but not that great. This is my first mobile game of that type and I really didn't hate it at all . But still this had auto attack option which I hate the most . I play this game is for the story that they had if the story was not that good so I really uninstall the game without a second thought . And I request to remove auto attack option from the game it make the game worst .Too be honest I didn't think it as a game I really think it as a anime
Mathu Sutanan	1	November 12, 2020	Server problem
wee boy	5	November 12, 2020	nice game
anurag singh	4	November 12, 2020	It's definitely good and gameplay everything is good but I am eagerly waiting for marvel future revolution please release it
Solarai	4	November 12, 2020	I would give this a five star, but I'm having a lack in graphics right now. So by the time it changes to the point where those special effects actually work, I'll change my rating. Forgot to add that the game's amazing in general.
DG Gamer	1	November 12, 2020	Just another copy of RPG like BDO(Black Desert Online) dont waste time plss....

Francis Ba Dum Tss	2	November 12, 2020	Why the autoplay? its just so stupid, remove the auto play and we would have a great game, and the pay wall is also hugeeee, i see you can get to lvl 100 off the bat by paying money smh 😢

Daren Bay	1	November 12, 2020	Netmarble games are always boring .

Adrian Luna	1	November 12, 2020	Constant Network Connection Problem causing it to reload. Running on a S10+ and 200mbps... Other games don't present this problem.
Walton Newton	3	November 12, 2020	The connection to the game server sucks. Its disconnection rate is everything 4 minutes. Other than that. Not a bad game. Still gonna uninstall it.
david bent	2	November 12, 2020	egh. Boring. Game plays itself if u touch Auto. Up to lv 25 and ive done nothing. Story line unoriginal. Don't care what all NPCs have to say..redundant..text too small for phone...constant reward popups in the middle of battle 🙄
Lakhan Pandiyar	5	November 12, 2020	Osm game
Akash Mondal	2	November 12, 2020	It's not that great what i expected. I'm very disappoint

Matthew Chance	1	November 12, 2020	Gender locked classes. Auto play nonsense. Playing a game means just that. Uninstalled
King Khan YT	5	November 12, 2020	Gameplay is good , graphics are realistic , controls are decent. We all know there's one thing that should be fixed. Please remove the ViP system , we all need same gear and let's just say it most of the players are kids. They don't have money to buy ViP. One more thing .. please try to clear the screen itself. There is a bunch of menus on the same screen. Its annoying sometimes. Overall good game.
Adrian Robinson	5	November 12, 2020	love the game play and the graphics are amazing as well
Zain	5	November 12, 2020	very fun and great game
Hendy Dharmesta Saputra	2	November 12, 2020	This game no beautiful, make game like Iruna/Toram online is good. Full costumization, and manual.
Ehsan Majidi	1	November 12, 2020	bad bad bad badddddddd
Robin	5	November 12, 2020	Remarkable! I never liked open world MMO RPG game but this one Changed my mind. After playing for 2days I'm really getting addicted to this game. The whole game is well optimized. The fighting skills are amazing and intense, The graphics catches my eyes. The server is well optimized too for leg free gaming experience (May vary by location). However, There's too many options to look after kinda makes me confused. Don't ruin this game with intense pay to win bs. would be better if chars had voice.
Desmond Tan	3	November 12, 2020	I given 3 star just because the quest part. Should give player control do quest than auto. Just hint on NPC that more fun to player. If auto this auto that. What the fun about this game.
Dannielle Gavia	1	November 12, 2020	The concept is pretty damn solid. I'd really like to be able to play. But servers are trash so you can't stay connected to save your soul. 3g of space for something that disconnects every other 5 minutes.
Greg Duncan	5	November 12, 2020	awesome!
Patrick Hessenauer	1	November 12, 2020	Bad Lineage clone with worse graphics and cutscenes you cant skip. Took 5 min for me to uninstall. I had my doubts the moment i saw them trying to sell cash shop packs before launch.
Paul Niranjan	5	November 12, 2020	awesome keep it up.
nick ayers	5	November 12, 2020	so far so good
The Joeys epic videos	1	November 12, 2020	All the game is is cut scene soooooo yea
Aaryan kutthi	5	November 12, 2020	It's amazing but just got a single problem and that is that we can't select the gender of the character class, it would be great if you add to change the gender too.
Kōdinēshon	3	November 12, 2020	it an okay game to play when bored of bdm
melody smch	2	November 12, 2020	I don't have complain, my rating is enough to show the game is good or nah
Andrew Dawson	2	November 12, 2020	I......I don't get it. I'm level 20 and have pushed about 2 buttons. It literally runs itself, it needs minimal input from the player. Which is just as well as all the on screen text is so small you can't read what anything is anyway!
AADITYA CHOUDHARY	5	November 12, 2020	Yes,good game good graphices
hell dogggz	5	November 12, 2020	amazing, this is one of the best games i have ever played
Edwas Do	1	November 12, 2020	Just a copy of auto play games.
Andre Michael Pietroschek	3	November 12, 2020	More than 3 Gigabyte download to get a 20 year old style browsergame with nothing new and voiceovers from older games. Popups pester, as they come in a bulk EXACTLY, when players want to click a choice (mouse or touchscreen). Cool character classes, but too many menus to micromanage manually. NO FUN.
Urban Založnik	5	November 12, 2020	Really enjoyable game, even if you dont buy with real money :)
come_at_me	5	November 12, 2020	this is a MMO game most people would actually favor and the fact the animations on here is more than any other MMO game, I think even other people who dislike mmo would like this game more than the usual call of duty mobile or roblox.
Abdelrahman Alaa	5	November 12, 2020	Who hate auto play should stop QQ and play on PC.... 0 iq
Yana R	5	November 12, 2020	nice
Dcjoe94	5	November 12, 2020	Great game so far please update asap with controller support with options to map your controller to the buttons please honest I would gratefully play this game to the end please consider -DCjoe94
Friendly Face	4	November 12, 2020	Solid gameplay and mechanics. This game is really optimised for mobile and i really liked it somehow. The issues comes from the world chat that is cant be hide and most of its playerbase especially from Indonesia are toxic. Please regulate or hide the world chat altogether. We dont need more toxicity in these pandemic. Also please add spam protection in the world chat as well. The inventory also need some work because its very limited thus making lots of problem during dungeon and quest. Cheers.
DNA dynamite GAMING	4	November 12, 2020	Super graphics, Good game

Alvin Habana	1	November 12, 2020	Gender lock, autoplay again, no thanks these games need to die
Areia Amaya	3	November 12, 2020	Decent for me? I guess? Hmm...The game is pretty Ok but somewhat lacking of something.idk what's missing.Hmmmmmmmm......also if there's a female Templar or Female Assasin character would be good too..Hmmm..
Bunnygum	3	November 12, 2020	Basically your everyday mobile MMORPG. Main difference here is the decision of adding a battle royal. Unfortunately I've been burned out from playing so many that it's not really a bonus for me. if you're somehow not burned out from every game becoming a battle royal, you'd probably enjoy this more.
Kaushik Mitra	5	November 12, 2020	Been only 2 days since launch and I'm already lvl 51, thanks for launching A3. I still remember looking for an old game called still alive but I found this one instead. I'm glad I pre-registered I'm sure this game will grow as mobile needed mmorpg games and you guys gave it like a pack a punch by adding battle royale hahah.. So cool costumes, nice weapons too. Must download Also, my game crashes sometimes and can y'all please fix the bugs in future and like optimize it? Much appreciated.
Jeremy Martin	5	November 12, 2020	This is what I have been searching for in a mobile game!!! The graphics, the story, the characters, the combat style, this is the epitome of epic!! Netmarble you have won my heart as well as me free time. please play responsibly. 🤭
Dave Gilmour	1	November 12, 2020	Boring and so many connection issues for the BR

Pandora's Actor	4	November 12, 2020	Everything is fine in this game, love the graphics and storyline but I don't if this only happen to me that I don't get any sound from using skills. By the way keep it up Developer, I know this game is still new so no wonder some bug or glitch happened in this game now.
Ankita Singh	1	November 12, 2020	Game is doing auto on its own.bad graphics. Poor controlling character. Plus not able to understand the story. Character is moving own its own too.
chris wooddell	2	November 12, 2020	Hahh lame
Michelle Martin	4	November 12, 2020	Love the game, but add mounts and wings and a marriage system. We should be good
VIVEK DEOGHARIA	1	November 12, 2020	It shows that it is 90 mb but in real it is 2819 mb! And for this much space means we need a better resolution and ram like we need Asus rog phone for this game and when I downloaded the game in Samsung m31 galaxy it just slowed down my phone and it is hanging what! Really this game needs a elite version to play
M3t4lgr33rs0l16	5	November 12, 2020	great game has plenty of free benefits, and an afk thing that helps you grow
Lücky Vîî	4	November 12, 2020	Awesome game but need some improve

Kitty KitKat	5	November 12, 2020	Great game, nice story and everything... the only thing that bothers me.. There is an auto feat. and it gets super annoying. overall great game ԅ( ˘ω˘ԅ)
Ismael Victoria	3	November 12, 2020	very nice game and easy to play
Lloyd Leoncio	1	November 12, 2020	when I finished downloading the resources. it always promp that network unstable.. when i restart the game. i need to redownload the 198mb file. it always happen. cant even play the game.
bashawn	1	November 12, 2020	Gender locked classes is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in an MMORPG!! EPIC FAIL! That alone made me quit this game as soon as I started it....sad
Teddy Bagus Hernowo	1	November 12, 2020	Always stuck on screen character and force closed when go to game, please fix it devs i will change the stars if this problem is solved, i using LG G5 SE, thanks before

hazmat man	5	November 12, 2020	Get the heck out of my room I'm downloading this game
Dave Wylie	1	November 12, 2020	Boring autoplay game, nothing new or exciting here
Riesti Widyavianisa	3	November 12, 2020	Done playing, my only problem is the battle royale, sometimes suddenly appears at the end so the enemy already full and its basically chaotic chaos. The characters are fixed on gender, so I won't be able to play fem templars or asasin, and the game song background is kinda boring. Also at the beginning there's option to dl and change voice later, but I can't find it in setting.
Daniel Montano	1	November 12, 2020	I can't even play the game. Every time I open it up it gets to the language select screen and I get a pop up that have an error code on it and it just closes itself.
Jacquante Andrews	4	November 12, 2020	It's an exceptional game but it's just that the server keeps kicking me off
Player R	1	November 12, 2020	All this app does aside that it needs updates or extra installment then it resets itself and it keeps doing it every time that you click continue to try to get the installment needed for the software
Comet	1	November 12, 2020	is there a trading features? player to player?
Mike Gaines	3	November 12, 2020	Same click quest auto play game boring same old stuff different skin
3K GAMING	5	November 12, 2020	Nice
SLVSHY	1	November 12, 2020	This game is an absolute eyesore. They went with the dark, lava, cobblestone dungeon look, and it looks horrible. Distinguishing real players from ai demons in the midst of the ugly spell effects, is a nightmare. Honestly horrible and I regret even pre-registering.
J R	1	November 12, 2020	"I pre-registered for this game and found out that today it was out. It was suppose to download automatically as soon as it was available in googleplay. Been trying for 30minutes now to manually download the game and with no luck. I keep getting ""Pending"" after i click install. Will give 1 star for now"
Francoi Francoi	2	November 12, 2020	Updated review. Classic autoplay game, p2w is flowing on the wind, people already reaching high level (like lvl 78) on second day of game. Game and power balance is good, but I don't want a game that relys on cutscenes all the time! Need the function to disable autoplay and to auto skip cutscenes. As always, 2 stars. Still playing though; don't want my wasted $20 on a p2w game to go to the trash.
Afnan Danin Trihauli	5	November 12, 2020	Well, let's say this game is absolutely good and I'm not a fanboy of this game but i telling the truth the game is actually good and the microtransaction is still within reasonable limits. And this is honest review
brenton perkins	3	November 12, 2020	pretty good for a auto game, will rerate when I get higher level and learn more. hoping there is more co op stuff than I see so far (lvl 39)
Ashish Kumar	1	November 12, 2020	Boring
Kunal Magar	1	November 12, 2020	Very bad game I'm trying to install this game since 5 hrs but it just only showing 'download pending'.

Alonzo Pierce	1	November 12, 2020	The game was fun, until it got buggy and kicks me from the server every two minutes.
world view india	1	November 12, 2020	Ad indian culture role and impruve ai bots
Abiral Rai	5	November 12, 2020	Best
John Mackey	3	November 12, 2020	This game has elements to make it stand above the competition, borrowing heavily from BDO and D3 and offering PvE/PvP without forcing you to take either role too heavily. The constant switching between open and instanced worlds makes freezes/crashes during loads a common occurrence, not to mention endless cut scenes to explain a story most players likely skip through. Once devs add an auto skip option and allow inventory access during instances, this game will evolve into something bigger.
Gopal Sharma	4	November 12, 2020	Love this game
Anthony Phillips	2	November 12, 2020	Would give a 5 but Im stuck on a quest because i keep getting disconnected every 30 seconds and when i get disconnected it restarts the quest so im stuck
ayush bhandari	1	November 12, 2020	Very bad game😠
Pinder Dhillon	3	November 12, 2020	Good game
Chris Murphy	1	November 12, 2020	Terrible, and boring, a copy and paste of about 100 different copy and pastes. Can't you be initiative? You earn millions in revenue
Mr K	1	November 12, 2020	Auto Play = Boooooring! This is really killing the Android gaming experience. Please developers create something that doesn't amount to a brainless lemming experience. Try being original for a change.
amit agrawal	1	November 12, 2020	This game is fully autoplay. Only thing you have to do is accepting quest.
Shashikant Babar	1	November 12, 2020	Harmful to device

EDICT GAMING YT	5	November 12, 2020	It is the best game ever. I liked it
ANJU Singh	2	November 12, 2020	I am giving it 2 star because- the game is good. But it is need to download game data. Which is awful after downloading it because I expected I can play it after download but, it is compulsory to give it 2.15 Gb😱😡😡. It is small game😡😡. And y it is taking so much data 😫😡😡😡😫.
Mamata Swain	3	November 12, 2020	Nice game finally it has launched . I m getting more excited . But thereis a problem it again asks for download it again .
Franky Sbt	2	November 12, 2020	great graphics, gameplay like other mmorpg, install it if you hav high spec phone, thats all...
Tofan TV odia	1	November 12, 2020	Extra data pay
Chawimawia Rate	2	November 12, 2020	Well,it would have been nice if it was 3d and like I don't have anything to do,just let it auto play,why would you suck so hard when you're almost at the margin of a good game
Guyver	1	November 12, 2020	Just reminds me of lineage but with average graphics. English only server is full of none english people. Spent 5 min actually controlling my char in the 18 hours of gameplay( Auto pilot)...another pay to win game...
Neruby EX SHINE	1	November 12, 2020	What the!! Waaaah!! No voice and where's damage effect sounds! Waaahaw that's really dammit game! I was happy theres new MMO RPGs games to played on November times! But this one is dammit! Alot of Bugs and mestika everywhere!!
Adarsh jamwal	1	November 12, 2020	Bhai game wo hoti hy jo ki ham kheley na ki autoplay hoti rahey
toka bee	5	November 12, 2020	very impressive
ShadowXBlaster	3	November 12, 2020	Ok So it's a fine game. The graphics are good but a little less character customization. It got a wierd Battle Royal. Too many things added in this game. In my view, RPG should give you more customization options for characters (young or old or average aged character) and not just few selected. There are many things that I could say but I don't think it fits the kind of RPG that I think it should be.
Daniel Pirozzi	1	November 12, 2020	Boring game, medium graphics, full auto, extremely p2w, I don't recommend it.
Varun rao	5	November 12, 2020	a gud n fun game with high graphic 👍

Adam Chauvette	1	November 12, 2020	So far been downloading the game update since like 3pm my time. It's now 9pm. Absolutely ridiculous. Not even bothering. From what I have read, its pay to win and auto play anyway. How about an actual RPG that you have PLAY. Glad I spent 6 hrs downloading garbage and never even finished and then read the really bad reviews. Uninstalled and wont be back.

Gid Gannabis	1	November 12, 2020	I was so excited to play this game. Yet its juat another auto play game. Why do you make games that has auto play? Its good for grinding and farming while afk, i get the idea. A bad idea. You cant expect players to be immersed in you game if it has auto play. Its just that games like this are meant to be PLAYED. Auto play is the worst thing to ever happen with mobile games. Even worse than unnecesaary microtransactions.

FreynZ AE	5	November 12, 2020	My first impression is this game like other mmorpg but it change my mind cause of the battleground mode that have many varible weapon that not stick on main class. Even sometimes i feel lag maybe cause of my bad network. But the way keep it up and i wish more interesting event and also always try fix the problem. ( ^-^)b

Latest Creativity	5	November 12, 2020	Good graphics
JohnnyWiz777	1	November 12, 2020	I would give it 0 stars but I can't. It's a typical autobattler game with albeit great graphics. But the main purpose for the zero stars is I can't even connect to the damn game. And when I finally do is disconnects every 30 seconds. I can't do anything! Let alone a quest. In all regards biggest disappointment for a mobile game I've had ever. Especially after having waited so long with the pre-registration. And nothing to even make the pre-registration worth it.
Ejay Ebuen	5	November 12, 2020	Please add more camera setting like manual camera rotation, that you can rotate to see behind you.. thanks..
Rimphal Singha	5	November 12, 2020	OMG
T Maus	1	November 12, 2020	Nothing original -and attacks are so busy you can't see anything. After 10 mins of play the game started playing itself. Why do so many companies put out a product that plays itself. Uninstalling. It was a waste of space.
Rakesh Goswami	1	November 12, 2020	Kapel
Rikky Green	1	November 12, 2020	I have a top model note 9 and barely got the game to even run. Everything is like a slide show and its just an auto battler. It's basically watching a video at lowest possible quality just so it can run. Looked interesting to begin with but it's just a piece of trash. TLDR DON'T INSTALL!!!!
Shivam Nishad	5	November 12, 2020	Nice game
Bikash Keshri	1	November 12, 2020	In-game download needed. Do some thing and do all obb files in playstore
John Doe	1	November 12, 2020	"Lol, I'll be surprised if this game is ""still alive"" next week. I pre-register for this game, installed, and now it won't connect to a server. Unreliable servers is bad sign the game will be bad. Thank God I didn't purchase the pre-registration package."

jd fugen	1	November 12, 2020	A3 means autoplay3..i suggest auto only for moving or going to the quest..then killing mobs and boss is manual..like rebirth online..thank bye
Vishal Singh	1	November 12, 2020	Waist your time
zinx	2	November 12, 2020	Game looks and runs okay. The gameplay is very funky. Autoplay is 95% of the game and even that doesn't work well. It won't accept and confirm alot of quests. Gets stuck if you run into a tutorial. Your soul linker (companion) who fights along side you does double and sometimes triple the damage over you. Manually targeting is not good. Camera is the worst I've seen. PvE is boring. Battle royale mode is fun for a bit.
Lewis Hogbin	1	November 12, 2020	Another auto play game..... click a button and watch the game play itself! Uninstall straight away. Thanks for deleting the last review
Prashant Pushpad	5	November 12, 2020	🙂
Mhasilie Kruse	3	November 12, 2020	Was having high expectations but like many other new mmorpg games, the graphics is detailed but isn't eye-catching also the autoplay function is boring, games are to be played and not watched. I would love it if classes are not gender specific.
Ryan Blake	1	November 12, 2020	Read in reviews that it is an autoplay game, deleted it before I opened it. Another terrible, generic mobile trope deleted off my phone.

DrazAF _	5	November 12, 2020	I love the mechanics and im super glad i preordered this game! Job well done!
TubeSock	3	November 12, 2020	PROS: Good graphics/ clean UI/ balanced auto and manual play/ plenty of quests to complete (including hidden quests)/ good VO and cut scenes. CONS: Difficulty accessing some of the controls on the UI for smaller screens/ networking and connectivity issues (I am assuming the emergency maintenance is to address these issues). This is one of the better games with the auto-play feature (makes quests easier while punishing players during pvp, raids and events). Will update once I hit endgame.
Anandha Krishnan	4	November 12, 2020	Good

Steel Stel	2	November 12, 2020	A nothing game that insists on autoplaying itself constantly and where tons of monsters hang around all around you doing nothing. You can see the microtransactions coming a mile.off.

Bagus	1	November 12, 2020	There are 3 currencies in the game, Some items and premium draws can only be purchased using White Gem. There's no way to obtain white gem throughout the game unless you pay. Man, how I miss decent real MMO games back then... not this cash grab fest.

Arkvoodle Of The Sacred Crotch	2	November 12, 2020	Don't know why this game is so hyped. It's so auto play that you actually have to fight against the auto play mechanics. Maybe the battle royal mode gets better but from what I saw it's clunky and basically whoever gets ahead stays ahead (winning get you better gear). I give this game 2 months max of hype... it really could be great but isn't

Jackson Davis	1	November 12, 2020	It's a another auto play game unbalanced probably botted battle royal mode and lack luster story that's not even that good don't waste your time or space on your phone downloading this. It's just a copy & paste of lineage 2

Mc Diego	3	November 12, 2020	So far i played, this game is great, the graphic is beautiful and the combat feels impactful. Menu is clean i like it. Im not a fan of auto pilot or combat in mmorpgs, but in this game i kinda understand why it has so its ok. Second, please dont make A3 like Lineage2R(heavy pay2win). And third, when combat happen, fps drop really bad(55fps-34fps). Please fix it. Thats all for now. Thanks Netmarble.

The Lone Wolf	1	November 12, 2020	I really hoped it would be great. I am huge fan of Evilbane. And this one was expected to be better than that. But when i first played this, its simply disastrous. It is slow, graphic are not as good as they marketing it, tiny characters, very slow movements of character. It's really disappointing. It is not even close to evilbane,an old game. They are not evolving, its gradually declining in terms of quality.
Ephi Santiago	2	November 12, 2020	For now, I will give it a 2-star rating because I haven't played the game yet since it always states that there is an unstable server connection even if I have a fine network connection. If it still continue to be like that, I will uninstall this game instead...

Which can be depend upon players luck and small combat or puzzle event for obtained treasure. make sure upgradation of player have different wayes you can also use elemental type upgradation. Furthermore at specific level player can combine elemental powers and many more, make sure you add different treasure randamize on basis world map. XD).

R0N1N // RogueBeats	2	November 12, 2020	In my opinion i believe this game was a missed opportunity. From all of the stuff i have read about this game, i was quite hyped for it. Well until i found you you could literally autoplay the entire game. This game would have been really fun if it gave us more of an open world experience instead of the main story quests.

infamous Dbrown	5	November 12, 2020	Awesome game. Was auto skipping dialogue but might not for new quest as I continue because some of it is actually funny. Auto battle is on point. But for real the skin color option is what I love the most. It means a lot to some people.

P̷a̷n̷i̷c̷ M̷a̷s̷h̷	2	November 12, 2020	This could be the best rpg game but the truth is that its not, first when i played i really liked it the graphics are good but there are many issue in this game. Firstly it always says server disconnected Secondly, there is no sound when we hit or kill a enemy which make the game very boaring for no sound there is only the music and Thirdly, the game is a bit laggy, iam playing on good device one plus 7t pro, so it should not be lagg. So, if u could fix this than it could be the best game! Thnx!

Fientjuhh WOWS L	3	November 12, 2020	i liked frist the concept altrough not a fan everything can be auto and repetitive. but reason off 2 star drops is its poorly optimized frame rates and lag (yes i have good and stable connection only this game suffers) migt be due to EU. and also set everything to low settigs or high doesnt fix any off frame rate /lag issues.
Dragon 211	2	November 12, 2020	Don't know much about the game but I'll update my review after a month or so , hopefully the game isn't overly pay to win. Edit: just an auto play game that wants your money, if your into that enjoy.

Exerto com um bug que é logo no tutorial, os NPCs(Parceiros) ficam batendo no nada e a historia não seguia enfrente(finalização do tutorial). História sendo bem atrativa👌 Gráfico, efeito (sonoros e especiais) estão top👌 Sem qualquer contato com Lag(to impressionado com isso)💥 Filmes&Gameplay fluindo sem qualquer travamento👌 Não dou 5 estrelas porque ainda não explorei tudo.

Rohan Medappa	2	November 13, 2020	The game loses 3 stars in gameplay and audio area. The game is so linear that it makes you sleepy after 30 mins of play. It doesn't have anything challenging in it. You just jump from one quest to another without any sense of achievement. There are like a million weapons and armour drops which are just pointless to have, you just sell them when your inventory is full. The audio is in a different league of sadness, the dialogues are having incomplete audio and the worst is when you are in combat.

Soldier 101	1	November 13, 2020	Great game overall and I was among the bunch who pre-registered however I am disappointed to what this game has become. The lack of sound for movement and music is a bit annoying. The constant disconnection when I have a full 4 bar is even more agitating. The fact that this game lacks certain customizations for a desired amount. The story isn't as interesting as the trailer made it out to be. Able to skip dialouge but not certain scenes, I'll say its a work in progress or a potential wasted.

X 'A'_15_Ayush Kumar Rajdeep	5	November 13, 2020	I have not played it yet but think it is not too good because the everyone's post is of 1 star 2 star.
Pankaj Dongare	1	November 13, 2020	3gb of autoplay videos nothing more😑
Anthony Halverson	1	November 13, 2020	Still pending download...nice start 👌
A S	2	November 13, 2020	Game crashes constantly due to lag. Only one world boss that is defeated in 30 seconds. Turning into nothing but an auto play game. Can already see the p2w with the only way to get 7stars is premium currency, most you can get free is 5stars. Was excited as this was being shown as a BDM replacement, but with A3 it's all auto. The battle royal is fun but super laggy and crashes too. I will be uninstalling but might reinstall later to see if they fixed the issues.
Chandan Majumdar	5	November 13, 2020	Nice
ALI Badshah	3	November 13, 2020	Nice game but mobile need a 6 GB ram
Teguh Adiwinata	5	November 13, 2020	Recomend
Rehan Khan	5	November 13, 2020	Rihan...khan
FQY PW	1	November 13, 2020	"Again another mobile autoplay ""mmorpg"" clone. Autowalk, autofight, powerlevels, pay to win, probably stupid wings too. These are all the exact same games just with a new skin."
Hestiares	2	November 13, 2020	The game is too heavy to run even in a Galaxy Note 9 phone specifications Edit: The reply from the team does not even bother to read what I put on the specifications
nilesh raut	4	November 13, 2020	Okay
Jimmy Your Neutrons	5	November 13, 2020	A3 has been an amazing game so far not gunna lie. The only issue I have so far is that whenever I multi craft with the purple crystal essence. All the text on my screen turns into boxes. Tho this game just came out so hopefully it doesn't stay this way for long.
Akshay Pendyala	1	November 13, 2020	The game is not working in my phone
Shaik Aliyafridoz	5	November 13, 2020	Best game
Anime Otaku	1	November 13, 2020	The game just crashes. Its just shows a white a screen after starting and is stuck there. I have uninstalled and reinstalled still not working.
papa kenneth	1	November 13, 2020	Game data too big
Chris Vel	5	November 13, 2020	Another Auto play game , innovative, with over the top flashy graphics , the same amazing backround story that is just out of this world . Well done !!! This game should be named as a Wonder of our world , how truly amazing a human mind came up with this never before heard concept of auto play
Anita Hajong	3	November 13, 2020	I love gme
Anish Biswas	5	November 13, 2020	That game is good but it needs more stabilization and bug fixing overall the game is totally worth it but we need more customization on charecter please take care of it please more customization
Vikas Kumar Singh	1	November 13, 2020	Not in English
Shantanu Singh	5	November 13, 2020	1 no... hatsoff to developers .............
extremegamer	5	November 13, 2020	i will download now ;D it seems epic game
Mrinmoy Kundu	1	November 13, 2020	Dont install it's fake a3... Boring
Silver Cobra	1	November 13, 2020	Control and Gameplay? Press auto, Graphic? Mediocre at best, Monetization? Through the roof... cant trust anymore future games from the devs, cheers
INSTINCT OP	2	November 13, 2020	There is very chaos in the game and why is there auto Play features? It would be much better if you released a movie or show on this story instead of a game.
sanju p j	1	November 13, 2020	Entirely disappointed
Neil Gerst	5	November 13, 2020	Love it so far!
Koleng Thulung Rai	3	November 13, 2020	Don't download 😡😠👹 please please please please please please please please
ArvinX	1	November 13, 2020	Uninteresting story. Progression depends on how much you do AUTO-QUEST and AUTO-COMBAT even changing equipments you can just AUTO-EQUIP. Graphics are nice but then all you do is just watch the game as it plays itself. UI is too crowded, chat is unnecessary unless you just want attention. Basically a glorified IDLE GAME.
Jonas Einas	1	November 13, 2020	Auto-garbage game
sticks v2	5	November 13, 2020	good game❤❤❤
Lord Heroic	5	November 13, 2020	it's so much fun than Lineage 2
Agus Kong Ming	4	November 13, 2020	so amazing
Dom Greco 貴東明	1	November 13, 2020	Just finished the tutorial and I'm bombarded with buy this and that. It's like another pay to win rip off of black desert. Getting really tired of these predatory monetization practices....
Pat Siever	1	November 13, 2020	I only read the reviews, for the reason of it being auto play. I will not download, these games are trash and not even exciting. Blah
vignesh vignesh	5	November 13, 2020	Super🌷
Arbaaz Shaikh	1	November 13, 2020	Very bad .....doesnt move after login fails
rand omguy	5	November 13, 2020	While I'm still stuck waiting on blizzard for their mobile diablo. This game suprisingly once you understand how its intended to be played. Is very engaging. With potential crossroad events in storylines. Hidden mechanics. A very rewarding system to guide new players. And a very rewarding battle royal. Playing this game is very casual with an option to dive in full time with the wealth of content making multiple playthroughs a must down the road. It's fun to hangout on.
Cephas KING	3	November 13, 2020	So far so good I love it, but it's barely been a day I installed it, yet it's already stopping on its own. It's kinda really frustrating cause I love the game, I'll use some advices.
Steven Gallinetti	3	November 13, 2020	Great game so far.....except for constantly being disconnected from the server. Its not my wi fi i get 115mb down and 25mb up. Will change to 5 stars if it gets adressed.
Sree Goushik Rajaa	5	November 13, 2020	Nice
Nicolas Hutchins	1	November 13, 2020	It would have been a 5 star but do to the fact it reconnects me every 10-20 seconds that's why it's getting 1 star I have full 5G connection so it's not my connection. Please fix this if ur able to then I'd change my review to a 5 star rating. Please fix.
Sahil Pathan	5	November 13, 2020	Good
DEKAN's Game World	1	November 13, 2020	Stuck at 100% file resources download. After downloading +3GB data it gets stuck at 100% and then it says unstable network? When I try to restart, it goes back to download 192 mb and then same thing happens. It's like I'm stuck in a loop and it is waisting not only my data, but also my time. NOT WORTH IT! Uninstall.
Adjest	1	November 13, 2020	Oh boi, you guys don't learn do you? Maybe you should listen to your players for once and not repeating the same thing again and again, autoplay and sh*ts don't work yet you still persist on adding the features that we don't want. You should've allocate your manpower and budget to a single game and make it good from past mastakes and not just fast release of half-arsed games
Nodaug Nox	2	November 13, 2020	Auto play....
Douglas Mccloud	5	November 13, 2020	I would change one thing, remove the auto button force players to actually immerse themselves in this beautiful game instead off allowing the lazy method of letting the game play itself. Other than that great job devs, really well put together ❤
T2Clingy `	5	November 13, 2020	Good game. Looking forward for more update specially the option for free rotate camera . Option that you can cast skill or attack while moving. Thanks for another great game. Satisfied with the gaming experience! 👌 P.S To those people who complain about auto mode function. Then dont use the function. But I appreciate the auto mode function, why? Imaginge killing 100+ mobs for quest doing it manually? You out of your mind? Haha. Again, thanks for the auto function!
and peggy	2	November 13, 2020	Genderlocked mmo in 2020 still, peeved that all male classes are forced into melee once again.
Lu	1	November 13, 2020	Another auto-play game, feels like a walking simulator and lagging so so so bad.
Jovan Mijic	5	November 13, 2020	Great
Jeulian Tony Ramos	5	November 13, 2020	Nice gameplay and combat, pvp is battle Royale style so little p2w, character creation is great, and graphics are nice. Recommend definitely
Jennleigh Villanueva	5	November 13, 2020	Nice
thesinner you	1	November 13, 2020	the heck the server is not working 😠😠its suck😠😠 uninstall then install its not working
Jasen Thomas	4	November 13, 2020	This game, like most games, has it's good and bad. This game has so much potential to be a great game, though it currently falls short. I wish the customization was more vast, including the option to choose gender. The graphics could also be further improved. I also wish this game wasn't all about auto-gaming. I would much rather control the battles and adventures myself. This game needs some work, and since it's still relatively new, they have time to improve this game .
D K	1	November 13, 2020	Disconnecting every few seconds and starting same mission over and over.
Codyko Umlandhj	3	November 13, 2020	Really great game but I haven't been able to play the battle royale which is why I was excited for this game in the first place. Every time I que the game kicks me and when I open it back up it completely logs out. I could get back in but never in time before I'm dead. I use a moto g6 and I'm hoping I don't have to upgrade.
Shawn Hazlett	3	November 13, 2020	3 stars. Like the game but keeps disconnecting from the server. Please fix it. And no its not my connection.. Every other online game does just fine...please fix it.
Vivek Gautam	5	November 13, 2020	Best
shahrukh ansari	1	November 13, 2020	Not working
Ken Masters	5	November 13, 2020	better than Rohan TBH.. For biginners, you will love the battle royale content in this game...
mymainflo 96	5	November 13, 2020	amazing so far! little bit of lagging when playing. please fix. but overall still amazing!
JA Hay	4	November 13, 2020	I did not get the preregistration pack.
Xtian castro	5	November 13, 2020	More updates and more upgrade.. I like the game like Diablo? And more characters and fix bugs and lags
Mia Mckean	2	November 13, 2020	Could never get it to work
Sam Sheckells	5	November 13, 2020	Lobe everything except the battle Royale mode doesn't have a auto play feature like story mode. Im not much on virtual gamepads.
Graeme Dougan	1	November 13, 2020	Unimpressed and uninstalled, too many of these 'auto mmorpg's' around these days to make me want to fully explore the game, real shame, nice graphics and sound does not make up for the fact that the game just pretty much runs on auto.
Martin Fetter	1	November 13, 2020	SAMO. Same autoplay nonsense. I do not understand. If you want to watch something, go to youtube. If you want to make something for people to watch, make a movie. This is more trash that guides you every step of the way. Zero challenge. Just tap to confirm/buy. How did people stoop so low to find this drivel (and the other 99.9% of the play store that is exactly like it) to be anything worthwhile, stimulating, entertaining, challenging, interesting, etc.? The bar must be really low these days
Michael Mitchell	5	November 13, 2020	Awesome Awesome love the whole setup and by the way I love the auto it gives my thumbs a break from pushing buttons and im soooo tierd of pushing buttons so keep up the good work cant wait for scholar
Virginia Wright	3	November 13, 2020	I like the game so far. I do keep getting disconnected from the server that I'm on, I checked my other games and they connect just fine and stay connected, so you might want to check this problem out.
Not Vlad	5	November 13, 2020	Let me give you some straight facts here. Anyone giving this game 1 star literally downloaded it for 5 minutes and uninstalled it without giving it an actual go. This is a PHENOMENAL game with extremely deep mechanics, tons of dungeons, group and guild content, and more. Yes, there's an auto battle focus, but it's the best auto battle I've ever seen with the ability to micromanage skill order and auto combo order. The amount of QOL convenience jammed into this game is second to none. Just get it
Ragnar Hewins	1	November 13, 2020	Another auto play mmo i seriously can't believe it what a huge disappointment to make a beautiful game that you don't have to do anything but press one button to play the whole thing.
Mark Grice	5	November 13, 2020	there are few problems but this game needs to go on consol as to be honest its better than some games on consoles helpers that truly help keep up the top work
EthOs Scales of the Black Rose	5	November 13, 2020	love it
Kaye Ann Gonzales	1	November 13, 2020	I have pre registered here does it mean i can't claim my preregistration rewards? It sucks to see other player with low level but high CP because of reward! It's unfair i have preregistered it but it says my email does not preregistered yet
Ethan Beanz	5	November 13, 2020	Been playing for a bit and I love it the graphics are amazing and I've started my own guild now I'm telling my friends to get the game so they can join me.
Axel	1	November 13, 2020	Auto play game
nathan potenza	5	November 13, 2020	A awesome game
xe! mau	2	November 13, 2020	Next game that plays itself...
Charlie Looc	5	November 13, 2020	This game is pretty fun so far and the graphic is very nice. There are plenty of things to do to keep you busy. Hopefully we get updates regularly to keep this game a alive.
LTE CRX WM HLA	2	November 13, 2020	Pls delete auto quest and auto farm, no one want to play a game that YOU DON'T PLAY. U can do it better, i'm sure u can do of this a great mmorpg.
Ilham Pradana Putra	1	November 13, 2020	Soulless character design but background design pretty good and gameplay are not that special and poorly optimized game. Basically levelling and farming simulator kinda game without anything specials. Goodluck playing this without getting bored
Legend. B	1	November 13, 2020	Shut down this game..u guys use fake reviews.people review how good the game and graphic when wasn't official open..how sad..I read all bad review and they telling the truth..your game suck with autoplay and money thief..only love 1 thing in this game..is character select screen.has good animation..I uninstall and never download again
Ryan & Stephanie Naughton	5	November 13, 2020	Without a doubt, the best game period!!! Try for yourself and find the awesome that is A3
Mei Mei	5	November 13, 2020	I'm 28 levels into the game & while I still have a lot to unlock, I can honestly say that I'm enjoying A3. The graphics are great & the story is interesting. I love the voiced dialog & cut scenes. Many people don't like the autoplay function, but I like it since my wrists hurt quite easily. The autoplay can be turned off, so it really shouldn't be an issue. The tutorials are also helpful without being overwhelming & the UI's nice. Overall, the game is top quality in the MMORPG mobile genre.👍🏻
Vaidotas Galkauskas	1	November 13, 2020	Just another crappy game
Chainyai Tesia	2	November 13, 2020	Im not getting any character code. Yet I havent pre register though.
It's me	5	November 13, 2020	This review should be about game but I am writing it for game story. Its basically a MMORPG like others but good part about this is its story, most of us have seen hundreds of games like this but this had a diffrent story, and that what I like about it. So many twists and cliff hangers.
Kn4cka	1	November 13, 2020	AUTOPLAY!!! WHY!????? why in all that is holy does this game have autoplay?, why bother creating a game if your just going to add autoplay so players don't have to play, the whole point of a game is to PLAY IT! not have the stupid game play for you, for crying out loud devs REMOVE IT! PATHEIC DEVELOPERS UNINSTALLED!!!
edward abela	5	November 13, 2020	Beautiful graphics with very good gameplay and good controls too. Thank you 😁
Abdo Ait	4	November 13, 2020	The game is good but it always disconnect even with good internet

Buzz Kirkpatrick	1	November 13, 2020	It kept diconevting from server? I have the fastest internet available?every time it started again i had to start over.....
Clint Taylor	1	November 13, 2020	Auto play isn't fun there's nothing good about games like this having control over your character is what we all want.
Panthera W	1	November 13, 2020	With good device and good network game still says can not connect. All other games can,but this one can not. 1 star simple because i even was not get in game to look how it is. Fix it then i may change my mind.
Dan mh	2	November 13, 2020	Man really? Another auto play? Seems like you guys have too much money because you really don't seem to care one bit to make a research about the game market, many games have failed because of auto play, best example is V4 from nexon which failed so bad because of auto play. I give you 2 stars for good graphics but thats all.
Old Vergil	2	November 13, 2020	In short itsTraditional afk cashgrab p2w game. auto quests auto combat just like in any other boorig so called mmorpg games. 2 stars for battle royale main game itself is auto trash.
Alcher Libot	1	November 13, 2020	THE AUTO RECONNECTION SUCKS!!!! WHEN THE STORY BEGGIN AND GOT DISCONNECTION, THE STORY WILL BACK TO START, GUES WHAT CANT FINISH THE STORY QUEST...
karthikeyan k	3	November 13, 2020	Ok Your Game is good but, Battle Royale is not fair for all players only some get high level in match easily and win while for players like me its hard even to get level 10 in that match. The dark battlefield doesn't suit Battle Royale have some lights and limit max level that player can reach in battle royale. Story mode is ok for me.But their also need lots of improvement
Anti Cookie	5	November 13, 2020	epic game I love it
Amelia Jardinez	5	November 13, 2020	I like it
Kc Ashley	5	November 13, 2020	I love this game. This is by far the best one yet I have played with the up most bestest graphics! Ps:) if you can't find me - this is where I am.
Josh C	1	November 13, 2020	Game Crashes every couple minutes during play (even w/all settings low and music off). Motorola G5S+ Android 7.1.1 3GB Ram. 12 of 32GB storage free. 1st support reply, canned-response, troubleshooting fixes (already did them). 2nd reply said they would push the ticket to higher ups, but not to expect quick fix (it will take time). Support replies quick, 4-8hours after contact, but keep marking ticket closed. I'll update rating/review after fixed and play dragon raja or summoners war until then.
Vodoodiamond	4	November 13, 2020	Love the game so far
shane cook	1	November 13, 2020	Gliched graphics, and fairly low resolution overall (note 20 ultra). Zero immersion while constantly popping up the screen option choices of accept or continue. That is the entire game (accept or continue) and a massively over hyped pile of junk. You Can find examples of this style of game play done 100 X better anywhere but here. The cammera system is some mix of non stop shakey cam and constant screen vibration with in your face light strobes. You can not actually follow what's happening.
DarkWolf_Boy04	5	November 13, 2020	In all honesty I love the gameplay in this game I never really find games with this type of gameplay. I do see room for improvement but right now it's really good.
Karun Nahar	2	November 13, 2020	Didn't download the some files by mistake when installing the game. It said that I can download later from menu later, but I can't find the option please help to download the files asked to download before main game installation. Please help. It's voice or audio files. P.S.: I meant the files (??mb) that are asked to download before the download of main game installation which was around 2900mb.

Louis Dupper	1	November 13, 2020	Random 3 minute shutdown, could never play the battle royale, security and network errors every 2 minutes, the sound...., Never had sound, only had voice at the beginning then it stopped and had to play without sound effects, voices.
Veeraiah Giddaluru	4	November 13, 2020	Super
devin montgomery	1	November 13, 2020	Another Auto Play game.... I can't understand how clicking one button and then having your guy automatically run and complete quests/kill/loot is any fun at all. If you're into auto play, the graphics look nice. Just absolutely zero fun to me. I wish auto play MMO's were a completely separate category
Mhaster	5	November 13, 2020	Very nice

David Dishington	1	November 13, 2020	In spite of how beautiful the game is, it's not worth downloading. I downloaded it but it kept disconnecting me from the server. I restarted it twice with the same result. Not worth downloading.
arctic timberwolf	1	November 13, 2020	Game keep saying im disconnecting and the assassin class is hiting out side the rage of his attrack zone and monster keep gliching untill this is fixed im not rating it any higher iv been wait for the game to come out and it needs fixs im on a stylo 5 plz fix these problems because i know some people are having the same problem
Roodney Vargas	5	November 13, 2020	Absolutely a awesome fun game. Play to win style. Finally something good! Beautiful graphics! I've read some negative reviews about p2w. If you all took your time to go through and read on the achievements rewards and the 30 day login rewards and level rewards you get a heroic soul link, heroic armors, weapons and much more free. All you have to do is play, grind for it. Like any other game. You can have fun and be a f2p player too. Stop being lazy and enjoy the game 🎮.
Avadhoot Bhole	5	November 13, 2020	For all those whining about auto questing, you do know you can very easily turn it off. Oh wait, you don't. Haha sorry
Kimmie I	1	November 13, 2020	Wont let me accept terms
P C	5	November 13, 2020	"Still new at this game, I pre-registered before it came out. Thought ""It looks fun, why not?"" Wow! So glad I did! The graphics are Awesome!

Yusuf Taufaniahmad	5	November 13, 2020	TOTALLY WORTH IT TO PLAY, anyone who's wonder about this game, literally it's f2p friendly, there's a lot of bonuses u can get, and be able to support all of u in the game. For the devs long last for the game keep it lovely up
Gurmaher Singh	5	November 13, 2020	Very awesome game

Nero Archangel	1	November 13, 2020	Just leaving another 1* review. It's netmarble don't expect anything from this trash company. Only trash p2w, recycled old games. Look at all other 1* reviews on all of their games. This company should be banned from google play. Scammers and false advertisers.

Chris Maala	2	November 13, 2020	All in all its quite good, graphics are quite good, but from my 1hour of playing, i found it hard to control, mostly in my archer class, it is attacking on knowhere even there are mobs nearby, you have to use the TAP LOCK-IN FEATURE to target mobs. Hope it will be resolve soon. Thank you.

Ansuman Mishra	3	November 13, 2020	Graphics good
Aditya Shukla	1	November 13, 2020	WHY DON'T YOU PEOPLE MENTION THE ORIGINAL SIZE OF THE GAME? This game requires +2GB of downloads after installing it. This is just not mentioned anywhere in the description. What a cheap way to increase installation counts on Play store. And what is this game? There is nothing for me to play. It's on auto-play. This ain't even a game, it's a demi-game. Graphics are super good.
Bagus Githa	2	November 13, 2020	Force Close
Mikaiss	3	November 13, 2020	The game is alright. My only complaint is world boss. It gets downed in less then five minutes of it spawning making it impossible for others to get a chance at it. Highly suggest they find a fix to it before it hurts the games player base!
yamraj song	2	November 13, 2020	Bad game because it's to much net and and also so much time to open

Jose Martinez	4	November 13, 2020	I've been playing the game for a little bit now and now I can write an actual review 2 gameplay easy to play the controls are easy to use the storyline seems to be pretty good so far and I'm just hoping you guys add a lot in the future like content-wise and events during holidays you know like Christmas boss or Halloween boss fights and stuff like that other than that the only problem I had was when I logged in the first day I wasn't able to collect my first reward which is 100 K Coins
Anggi I.H.S.	4	November 13, 2020	Kecewa nggak dapet ancient equipment. ☹️
Inderjeet Singh	4	November 13, 2020	Wow this game is really awesome and have a beautiful graphics really love this game, but why I've given four stars because it was taking a too much long time to downloading it and it will be take 1 hour to download my 2GB has already gone cazse I put it in at half an hour please take some action , but I'll support you and your community to make this game much better thank you and have a nice day.

Carlos Arellano	1	November 13, 2020	"I have been looking forward to this game for a long time. I am disapointed though. The art is a 10 ☆ The mechanics are a 10 ☆ The story and voice acting is a 10 ☆ The ""Auto play and Auto Combat"" is a 1 ☆... Get rid of the Auto Play and you will have a beautiful gem! It's a game I would dump a lot of money into cosmetics. I really hope you take everyones advice and remove ""auto feature"""

Lexie N.	1	November 13, 2020	Well I did install it and it looked quite interesting. Managed to do the tutorial and after that when I started the actual playing I got kicked out and it never let me return. So obviously uninstalled it. So clearly you have some issues with this game.
Althea Lyngdoh	1	November 13, 2020	I can't get any code and it can't start...am tired after using all my data now it's not working too...

Annapurna Kyatham	1	November 13, 2020	Waste game, don't download this game anyone because game was full of ads.There is no play list so don't download the game
Random Person	1	November 13, 2020	Autoplay for everything, skills, gear, moving, fighting... Endless tutorials for basic mechanics... Another souless game... Class and spells are cliché.. Ill wait for diablo immortal.

cesaw70	2	November 13, 2020	Bad controls, very little information about anything and not enough control over you own character. As with most offerings from Asia, the devs won't let you have control over your toon, you are forced to what they want you to do when and how, to hell with what you want.
Lisabeth Dixon	5	November 13, 2020	LisabethDixon Save
Rendy Handoko	1	November 13, 2020	Just regular auto play MMORPG, nothing special at all.
Summer Rayne	1	November 13, 2020	Like I stated on the web itself, in simple Netmarble fashion it always seems the devs forget to realize that girls play games as well not only boys. Only giving the option to play one girl role is total BS therefore I am just going to refrain from trying out anymore of your sexist games!

Jaxon Reppond	3	November 13, 2020	The lag in this game makes it difficult to play sometimes. When you can play with non lagging frame rate, it's cool, I like it.
Surendra Kumar	5	November 13, 2020	Very good
daniel mendoza	5	November 13, 2020	this game is great right off the bat this game IS NOT PAY TO WIN wich is a huge bonus paying of course will get you equipment faster but that does not matter their are equipment dungeons wich you can go to anytime you want to get heroic gear it take a while but it's free for everyone everyone have a chance to be strong it's open world wich is great guild event wich is great all kinda of rewards for everyone tht partake in world bosses it's a win win try it you'll like it if you've played rpg's
Dmitri Diakov	1	November 13, 2020	A great looking pay-to-win, super linear with a decent story line, being a carbon copy of a 100 linear adventure games out there this game got boring super quick, battle royal is meh, got bored before I even got to the point of spending crystals, which would kill my experience. Looked promising but the greed of netmarble is too glaring, not even worth the whale race.
derpyVfazbearX 6	3	November 13, 2020	It seems fun but the auto play is a huge issue as well as the lag the game runs but movements are lagged even on lowest settings
Budi Sulistyo Angkadjaja	5	November 13, 2020	Very Addicted Game
Jack Columb	2	November 13, 2020	I dont understand the idea behind a game that plays itself. Why would I want to come back to a game that I haven't done anything in except pick a class. There is nothing here to captivate players and keep them coming back. I played for about an hour and was done watching the same thing repeat itself auto run auto attack auto skills auto health pots. Yaaaawn. Looking on the good side if you need help falling asleep open this game up and watch it, you'll be snoring zzz's in no time.

Andrzej Nieścieruk	4	November 13, 2020	Osobiście jestem zawiedziony, następna gra która sama się przechodzi, czyli auto. Po części tak, jakby oglądało się stream gry. Wiem, że są takie czasy co do gier na telefon, dlatego przerzucilem się na inne platformy. Sama gra ma świetna grafikę, prawdziwe dzieło sztuki. Wygląda fenomenalnie. Wprowadzenie również jest interesujące. Jeśli ktoś jest fanem samogrywalnych gier jak najbardziej polecam, oczy będą zadowolone.

RAJESH SHARMA	5	November 13, 2020	This game is very nice
Big Brother	1	November 13, 2020	A Copy of Black desert with a different name. Why are games copying styles & trying to milk a category of style? Something about the gaming industry right now; it lacks creativity in ideas of play style. Very unoriginal design of gameplay.
The Outpost	1	November 13, 2020	This game total. 2gb 300 mb don't be fool 😂😂😂
Reynol Aviles	1	November 13, 2020	You don't really do anything, just keep charging your phone in auto mode and the game does it all for you, which sucks in my opinion, I was expecting more, too bad.
Anil Kumar	1	November 13, 2020	The graphics are so poor, and the design of the game is bad.... Game is so silly, worst game ever
Eric Lee	1	November 13, 2020	Copy paste from BDM and your old L2R, just different skin but same core, enough of this NM. You are big publisher, how can you not even match up with some small pub that can do way better and less grinding. Another fail NM game.
Aaron Anthony	1	November 13, 2020	Poor performance even when adjusting setting, on a note 9. Glitchy cut scenes and game play.
Jacob Scott	4	November 13, 2020	The graphics are truly amazing and the game play is quite enjoyable. My only complaint is not being able to customize and adjust the camera view. Please give us options to adjust the views.
pb panda	5	November 13, 2020	To fix the issue of it disconnecting constantly I had to turn off backround data on all the apps i had individually. Once i did that and turn off sync while playing it ram smoothly. Normally i turn off backround data anyway but forgot after installing new games. The auto battle is still fun and lets you target and pick attacks. The side quests and games are fun as well and the graphics are still beautiful on medium setting.

Crypt Omen	1	November 13, 2020	Gameplay is visually a chore to keep up with. Autobattle makes it pointless to do so, but also makes it pointless to play. All the cutscenes froze. The gamedata download took an hour. Create a character is impressive visually but the limited selection is weak. The automission feature and town made it seem like a cheap average mobile mmorpg, none of which have ever been worth playing. Incredibly disappointed, the idea had so much potential and they had the budget. Epic fail.
Yeppy Bahri	5	November 13, 2020	Amazing
Daniel Mells	2	November 13, 2020	It looks good and plays well but whats the point in playing a game that plays itself i honestly still don't understand the point in auto games
Jason VanHoose	1	November 13, 2020	I installed only to review. I seen in the comments no customization, auto plays its self, and gender lock so im not even going to open the game.
Jordan Price	1	November 13, 2020	Just another typical auto play and pay2win game. Extremely low summon rates, gender locks, the same boring classes, thin story line, repetitive quests, broken pvp, and the pve is just auto quests with odd world boss. The dungeons are boring and quick, no real loot? How can game designers not look at WoW and make a similar game... this is just a copy of V4 and many others. Wouldnt recommend.

Joaquin Parra	1	November 13, 2020	Another lazy auto-play. It hard to call this an actual game, when the game plays itself. The game is lack luster and boring because of auto-play.

Only problem is the and is very repetitive and the game gets very hard at 80 due to quest boss berserk timer. Main story can't be passed without at least 230k cp. I had to pay to get past it and in the end it's just not worth it

mfirmanarizki	5	November 13, 2020	Pretty good.
Niz 31	2	November 13, 2020	It's pretty useless to put shadow/wetness on the same setting as textures quality at least seperate it...the shadow setting only set the resolution of it while lowering textures quality actually turn the shadow off and the environmental texture wetness is ugly and cause fps too fall and phone heating up. If you want a beautiful game set it to high or ultra but be ready for your phone to melt. setting it to medium and I got 27fps even on 6gb ram phone, high 40fps and 47 degrees, good job
Aziz Efendy	3	November 13, 2020	i cant connet to the game even my connection is good enough to stream HD videos on Netflix

Randy Amora	1	November 13, 2020	I spent a lot of data downloading the game. Stopped and left a fraction and keeps saying it cant connect to the server. Waited for 3 days. Same issue. Can't play, checked feedbacks, another autoplay. Still giving chance. Maybe tomorrow the game will complete its download. My free storage is more than 200 gig. Internet is 20mpbs.

MARKSM401	4	November 13, 2020	Very good game so far. For a mobile mmorpg it isnt bad at all. I have made a templar to lvl 50 already. Havent paid any money. You honestly get plenty of materials to advance no problem. Only gripe rn is everytime I enter the dark lighthouse my game freezes and shuts my phone down. That is super annoying and needs to get fixed right away. Anyways good game overall. 👍

Timothy Schroder	3	November 13, 2020	From all the hype its not .. the graphics are great. Controls are good , alot of content. But auto play really.. why play the game if you don't play . You just watch.. defeats the whole point of gaming... and the packs are priced high . I know the developer needs to make some money ,but looks like another pay to win .

Sky Volt	3	November 13, 2020	I truly do wanna like this game, it looks amazing for a mobile game but after seeing its just another auto questing game killed it for me. I can't stand it when games auto quest bc whats the point of having a game then just letting it do everything for you? Guess I was hoping this game would be different from the others looks like I was wrong

Phoenix Parnell	3	November 14, 2020	ive been playing pretty much on all my free time when I'm not at work and joined a guild and bought a founders chest and got a nice weapon. The guild got together to fight a boss and I thought I was strong for the time I have played plus the weapon... and only did 3.4 percent of the bosses health. Someone else did 20+% on the boss. So this is a VERY pay to win game. If you wanna dump a sbit ton of money in the game dl this if you want to play free or just buy a box every now and then don't dl
Wesley Carbone	5	November 14, 2020	Having children kinda limits your availability to play (or do) a lot of things - gaming is definitely one. By no means does this game stand up to a console game; HOWEVER, it's probably best in it's class. Like I first mentioned, I don't have a lot of time and I've been looking for a great game in my downtime I can play on-the-go. Yeah, if auto-play isn't your style, this game gives you the option to be hands on or hands off. Not necessarily PTW.

Sam M	4	November 14, 2020	it' is really good. I just wish we could use our own characters and weapons in battle Royale. the graphics are good though. we just need away for free to play players to get diamonds without having to spend money.

Erek Armentrout	1	November 14, 2020	I downloaded this game to just rate. This is the only game that Google Play ever sent me push notifications about. I received 4 total over the course of the preregistration period. Once would have been fine, but 4 is excessive and annoying for a game I am completely uninterested in. Plus this game is no way similar to other games I've downloaded, so they clearly aren't matching my interests. Also, gotta love the developers generic response. Shows they don't care at all.

Sunil Kumar	5	November 14, 2020	fantastic
Ryal Deveau	1	November 14, 2020	Standard auto play diablo clone. Super linear gameplay, no character building, level 6 within 5 minutes. Controls are super clunky and hard to use. Turn on auto play and watch your game play for you, thats the only way to play reliably, not sure if it has controller support or not. I dont recommend. Along with every appearance of it being a Pay To Win game. Its just a NO for me. Graphics look great though.
Ayeehman Feudo	3	November 14, 2020	Still like some of those MMORPG games, the notification on the purchasable item stores are still keep on popping, This game is forcing you to buy their purchasable products in store even if you don't want to. The management settings of soul linkers are too bad, you can't manage it easily because it has a hard configurations. When you pick up the outfit for the first time they will put you on the first choice outfit. So choosing your outfit when you are creating a new character is useless.
Jagadish Jagdish	5	November 14, 2020	It's not bad
Ved Anand	5	November 14, 2020	Can anyone or even developers tell me that what is the difference between this and Geneshin Impact ???

Its the only game thats not auto. path, not auto quest, non genderlocked open world rpg that has no Nth server popping up every week. Damn i miss stellacept."
LeoLaredo	5	November 14, 2020	I love it. It is autoplay and I dont mind it. I do love the fact that I can leave it on AP and collect all of the rewards and upgrade my character's skills and talents all at once. I also love the resting rewards you get when you are not playing as well. I have not spent a single dime on it and thats a good thing. Its an awesome game, and I'm looking forward to reaching max level on all classes. Keep it up!

David Mac D	2	November 14, 2020	Looks really nice.but no new concepts.its got auto play so just lots of clicking and not much fun. Limited. Diablo was better 10 years ago. RuneScape looks worse but even it has better UI and game play. Battle royal was really fun but it just loses connection a lot and I have brilliant WiFi. Shame as now uninstalled if I can't do BR it's just a battery drain.

Timmy Peter	3	November 14, 2020	Always disconnect when finish the first soul linker quest
Michael DeSantis	2	November 14, 2020	Sadly I have to give this game a lower rating than I would really want to. Its a great game that deserves 5 starts, but it feels like it does little to innovate from all the other games like it out there. But the biggest thing for me is the gender locked classes. For me it really ruins immersion. If things change, I'm more than willing to return.
Devon Webb	4	November 14, 2020	Only because I the Battle Points are far to low. Takes forever to go up. Also, although it is still very fun, if I come in second I may get 4-5 points. But if I come in 6th I can still get that. That just seems a little awkward. I literally will have 6-7 kills. This should be something that you all look into. Otherwise this game is really amazing.
dennis scott	1	November 14, 2020	Boring nothing special auto quest , raziel is also trash
Christopher Kittle	1	November 14, 2020	P2W, laggy, not very well thought out GUIs. It's the worst game in its genre.

Ray Robinson	3	November 14, 2020	"It's not that this is a bad game by any means... but when you have competition like Genshin Impact you really have to up your standards. This game is just a little too ""copy/paste"" compared to other mobile games. You just tap the screen and watch the game play itself. It's almost identical to Lineage II in terms of environment and graphics... whose developers also developed this game. Coincidence? Lazy developers? You decide."
Bobbie Putera	1	November 14, 2020	"I enjoy this game. Its cool. But always having issue with "" DISCONNETING WITH SERVER "" ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT. PLEASE FIX THIS. AFTER U DONE FIX IT. ILL CHANGE MY RATING."

PDXTek Last	3	November 14, 2020	This game is beautiful and well crafted. The story seems pretty compelling. If it weren't for all of the automation it would be excellent. I miss the days when games were hard, and you had to play them yourself.
Bikash Poudel	2	November 14, 2020	"Pay to win gamefor sure even thought i paid but it's not enough, is never enough, drop rates sucks, there is not much to the game expect graphics, there is not much things to do, And there is not much BOSS even thought it has world boss is but again drop rates sucks, and it takes forever to kill mobs "" IT'S FRECKING MOBS"". And there are not much place to farm ex only quests so leveling up is super slow, AND why can't we change gander of our characters i really want male mage!!."
Furious Destroyah	1	November 14, 2020	[Insert complaint about autoplay and pay2win here]
Rob L	3	November 14, 2020	Good game if you like footstep asmr, it offers decent fights and skills that you have to rotate cool downs on and not just button spam. Fight and skill sounds are non existent and the music is annoying at best. I believe the game could be about 80% done, oh and its laggy.
Camerron Hartman	1	November 14, 2020	So this game has only been released for a few days and I have to agree with others the P2W and autoplay kill this style of game for me. Open world rpgs have dropped so much in the quality of game over the last 10 years. They are all copied and reskined to make a quick buck instead of making a dedicated player base that has no problem throwing money at an enjoyable game they can continue to play for years to come.

Layson Brooks	2	November 14, 2020	I keep getting disconnected from one of the recommended servers. Every 5 minutes and it's very annoying. Probably would be 4 stars if not for that. Should I change servers?
AnTiLiFe	3	November 14, 2020	This game has fantastic graphics but from the very start it autoplays itself, I know it can be turned off but I thought they were walking me through a tutorial because the game is so different from others but it's definitely no different and it really will play itself other than you having to press the next mission button, it does look lovely but like all games with auto play it's a little dull wether you or your phone is playing. The rpg side of this game is ok but BattleRoyale didn't work...
ForcedComedy	2	November 14, 2020	Boring, unimaginative gameplay. Auto-play of course. Nothing new. Im not sure why devs cannot get it right. Toram did. So it is obviously possible.
Devansh Desai	2	November 14, 2020	Damn why make mmorpgs with auto battle i don't get it although the graphic are noce and all but damn auto button makes it a waste

Don Chang	1	November 14, 2020	After a day 2 days of autoplay here are my thoughts. Cash grab and autoplay is the worst. Also the contrived story line lost me. Blah blah blah kill this. Kill some more. Graphics is pretty. Even then it get boring after 20 hours. Maybe allow me to move the character would be nice. But nope you are on rails and that is it.

Brian Hallers	1	November 14, 2020	I didnt even make it past the class select screen. Gendered classes. Automatically lost interest.
Guns4HireGaming	5	November 14, 2020	loving every minute of game play!!
Jotaro Kujo	5	November 14, 2020	Great game, it has kept me busy for the past few days and is fun because when you're not playing then you have an autopsy option you can turn on if youre bored. Overall the game is amazing and the only complaint I have is that you should add auto tracking/auto camera turns to the enemies when you're not playing in auto. Its very hard for classes like the Hunter class to hit their targets sometimes. Anyways if you can do that this game will be perfect. Thank you so much.
Joseph Lambert	1	November 14, 2020	Disconnection issues Tried to play for 30 mins. Seemingly every 30 seconds i got a notification that i was disconnected. Wasnt actually able to play the game. Kinda sad.
EJr SMooTH	4	November 14, 2020	Nice Game
Wan Masri	5	November 14, 2020	Love the game !!
Spencer Miller	2	November 14, 2020	Upset that i get disconnected during a match or in game every 30 seconds please fix this. My internet is very very good. So this shouldnt happen.
erick sawyer	1	November 14, 2020	Zero stars cause i have too start all over i passed the first part then it vles back too it
Zinx-Rin	2	November 14, 2020	Waits for the gender switch button.
Sun Wukung	5	November 14, 2020	epic game
Ugly Casanova	3	November 14, 2020	Just like all the other auto battle MMORPGs. Sure you could run from point A to B for the hundreds of typical fetch quests but I saw no need since the battles went the same. BR mode is kind of neat but you will just get stomped by p2w players so that's not much fun either. Looks good at least.
JansiTV	1	November 14, 2020	Good graphics but the game is boring and always disconnected
GoSuper PinkNinja	5	November 14, 2020	Damn this game is freaking awesome It's is a P2W but you can still Win off you just grind enough
MyEinsamkeit	4	November 14, 2020	Amazing game, very good character creation and customization features. Runs at 40-60fps most of the time, no problems whatsoever. Good Storyline, cool graphics, and despite what people are saying, the game is not auto play, you can turn it off. Netmarble does a good job with this game, i just hope to see PC version soon.
ArtForces BettaFish	5	November 14, 2020	Best Game rpg ever... I like playing this game
Nasty Palms	3	November 14, 2020	Meh. Not exactly what i thought
William Luster	5	November 14, 2020	really great mix of gameplay
Frank B	1	November 14, 2020	Auto play. Not a video game.
Roshi YOKO	2	November 14, 2020	Always disconnecting i have a 30MBPS speed of internet but still being disconnected . Its so irittating during instances .. I have to start all over again. Kindly fix this issue
Kirby Do	2	November 14, 2020	Unstable server for me, always get dc every minute.
The BirdIntern	3	November 14, 2020	Whelming. It's not bad. But it isn't great. It's not boring but it isn't fun. It's just kinda meh. Edit: for the developer review. The graphics didn't factor in at all. The graphics don't make a game boring. The gameplay, or lack of gameplay, make the game boring.
Betty PVP	5	November 14, 2020	I Give this Game 4.8 Stars. 👍 A3: STILL ALIVE Game Pros: 💖It's better than similar games. 💖Great Preamble Animation 💖The heroine is beautiful 💖Handsome guys in the game 💖Generous Google Play Experience Points (XP). 👏 Thanks to Netmarble ❤️ My Youtube Channel 👉 bettypvp

Ron Hoefer	2	November 14, 2020	It's almost a fun game, if it would stop disconnecting from the server. I'm thinking about uninstalling the game
Arabinda Maiti	5	November 14, 2020	Anupam Maiti
Kaine EightyTwo	3	November 14, 2020	Not my thing
Ethram Advon Caine	3	November 14, 2020	The game concept is great, but they should just ditch the idea of equipment drops in Battle Royale and just turn it as enhancing the equipment cause clashes become too unbalanced in the late game.
Kevin Cheng	3	November 14, 2020	Game crashes way too much
Steven Snyder	5	November 14, 2020	Cool game. Not play to win. Semi auto. Alot to do, sometimes overwhelming on everything to do.
Mashed Potatoes	1	November 14, 2020	Community is toxic af. And it's just another boring auto game. So not even worth the time.
Joshua Lindsey	2	November 14, 2020	can't play it properly because the sever always kicks me off and reconnects. fix this and I'll be able to properly rate the game.
Bunbun 01	1	November 14, 2020	Unoriginal story, average graphics and forgetful quests, not worth your time

B S	1	November 14, 2020	Boring, cookie-cutter garbage. Like Lineage 2 mobile, but with more lag and less fun.
justin bowyer	4	November 14, 2020	I enjoyed early game but its very clear after stage 9-37 the game was scaled to dps and not other classes im honestly about to give up on the templar its just falling off massively. I've been stuck fighting that swamp dragon for 2 days now The exp required to level means ive gotta go out for like 3 more days and farm afk if I wanted this id still be playing g afk arena. And for a game that wants to use a party system u made the story mode single player FIX THIS WE WANT TO QUEST WITH OUR FRIENDS
David Revelo Zuluaga	1	November 14, 2020	Very bored, the game does everything for one
phougat gaming	5	November 14, 2020	Op game
1k Without any video challange	5	November 14, 2020	oooosm
Jason Avery	1	November 14, 2020	Could have been ok gameplay, but it's yet another pay-to-win cash grab autoplay mashup that we've seen many times before. Looking past the obvious wallet targeting they have going on, it's no different than any other game in the genre that you can find on the Play Store. Not worth any bit of your time or money.
Kiran Gupta	3	November 14, 2020	Invoice header: *** Inc.
Andrew O	5	November 14, 2020	I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm very pleased and excited about this release after playing it for a good 30 minutes.

SoCoSLiM Albritton	1	November 14, 2020	Was a great game until recently all day every 5 seconds i get disconnected from server ( error code L01 ) + C01. It has always had connection issues but now its completely unplayable. Be nice if yall can fix this ASAP plz. If fixed this game deserve 5 stars.
GK HIRE	4	November 14, 2020	this is it !! it feels very great playing..but I hope they add the animation for normal walk and interaction with normal people perhaps a greet..!!
YT Rizky	5	November 14, 2020	nice game overall
Rshad Affandi	3	November 14, 2020	"Edit: If still planning to keep ""auto-play"". It should only be enable in ""dungeons"", for player to keep grinding for experience and items. Not during ""adventure"" mode when completing quest and story. I've been waiting for Diablo/Grim Dawn/Path of Exile style to be available in mobile games for a long time. Not auto-play adventure.."

Raj Patel	1	November 14, 2020	If take 2GB then why you write 90MB game
Arcorian	3	November 14, 2020	The game is good but something is off and I really don't know what it is. Maybe the repetition of doing the same thing over and over with nothing different happening?
Robert Thomas	5	November 14, 2020	Love it make a A4 still alive
P.meghanath Kumar	1	November 14, 2020	It is better
Mukesh Kumar Sah	5	November 14, 2020	Good
A A	3	November 14, 2020	As many reviews have said, this game is very much auto-play BUT it's graphics are great. For those who enjoy games that can play for you while you do your daily routines, I would suggest trying it out. For those who want to play your heart out with complete control, then stay away. I enjoy running the game while i read, eat, watch a movie/show, ect--- at least until just currently. I would originally give it a 4-star but because I disconnect consistantly every minute or so. Please fix this issue
Jimmylah Knighten	2	November 14, 2020	"Seriously someone needs to fix this crashing issue. I'm sick and tired of losing all my battles because the dang thing won't stop crashing! I have lost out on thousands of points because it crashes during Dark Presence and any other ""special adventure"" I go on. Very disappointed."

Subby Zeros	3	September 28, 2020	It's a great game but I just want to know, when will the game be fully published so everyone can play again?
andre racine	1	September 28, 2020	Used to be a totally different app. Now with update I have lost all progress. I can't transfer it over in anyway to the new app as I can't even login to the previous app. Scummy. Deleting both apps.
Nikolaos Evangelou	5	September 28, 2020	Look the game is cool and the concept as well but since the new update dropped I have lost access to my main lvl 27 base...
Samuel Ho	1	September 28, 2020	Stupid update. Now I cant even log in. When will this be fix. Update. What do you mean its not publish. When we try to login to the other version.

Emma Chan	5	September 28, 2020	The game has big changes at all the graphics is getting good and more realistic. Even I'm not a spender on this games you can still play as you can just take your time if u have free time to play. One thing I hate on games is Always giving me a 3 star ⭐⭐⭐ unit 😭😭😭😭 when I drew a 10x card.
Lowell Mari Manila	3	September 28, 2020	I love the game before the update... Now i can logged in.. I got well compensated.. But there are still more room for improvements...

Lee Lomax	1	September 28, 2020	Update, I still can't get in after many attempts developers are scratching their heads going i don't know meanwhile others are getting in no issue way to go
evan monar	1	September 28, 2020	I had a great account..invested time and some money into it only to lose it due to the update..this is ridiculous.
Harchiel Paul librea	1	September 28, 2020	After the update the game sucks, poor developer can't even fix minor issues, we are on a team fight we cant the our units nor the enemy's. If you cant do your job better refund us then shut down this game. Chat system has many problems too also the customer support sending screenshots in any chat system in the game is HORRIBLE this is madness.
Geoffrey Gonzales	1	September 28, 2020	I already done updating..but now how many hours waiting for log in..but didnt work..i worrying about my account to be a back to zero player?
derp smurfington	2	September 28, 2020	Imagine spending 350k gold for VIP ranks only to have the devs nerf the rewards into the ground and not offer compensation for it afterwards. Screwing over people that pay for your game is never a good idea.
Bradahutt	5	September 28, 2020	Nice game. But could you lower some research time.. Its great how u could spent time on this game. But seriously dude. For artillery research it takes two weeks to complete... I mean. Are we research how to understand a woman? Anyway. This game great.

Arif Ahmadi	2	September 28, 2020	Absolutely disgusting that I can't play the game after the new update looks like I have spent money for nothing. Absolutely inconvenient I have been trying for the last 20 hours and still not working .
Lawrence Bayley	1	September 28, 2020	Customer support is shocking your timings are all off for updates especially doing the update on a Sunday that is ridiculous also now you got the problem of most people not being able to get into there account come on sort it out
Joseph Reed	1	September 28, 2020	Latest update wiped me out, base attacked, massacred, resources and units wiped out, and all whilst I couldn't even get into the game. Yesterday working fine, today redownload as per requested, no access, and butchered so its now uninstalled. As you can see a generic response from the Developer's, I don't think that they fully understand the damage the last update caused us all, when I was finally able to log in I had been slaughtered by other players, and had lost everything. No point playing

Either can't login in to game or your account is missing and you have to start over. And again, no support from devs at all, they don't even bother to answer your messages.

Chris S	5	October 1, 2020	Good graphics
The DarkGamer	1	October 1, 2020	Downloaded this game and couldn't even create a new account and I find it weird that this game has almost 100% 5 star ratings when clear just by looking at all reviews that this game has a lot of 1 star reviews that aren't even being considered in the rating you have to scroll further down to see all the negatives reviews, and yes I have tried uninstalling this game and all data that has come with it and still just stuck on the create an account screen

Paul Saunders	1	October 1, 2020	App doesn't open, stuck on opening splash screen
micros112	1	October 1, 2020	The game forces colorful unrealistic named squadlearders on to you that you might not want and railroads you to play the allied prospective of ww2. Severely disappointing

Freeboy 9908	4	October 1, 2020	It's good, but it's drain my battery very fast. I hope you can fix it 🤓
FLYING PIZZA	1	October 1, 2020	It says game not supported on this device, try a different divice. real shame that a Huawei y6 from 2018 isn't supported to run a 2020 game. So disappointed for what looked like a great game.
BOSSKUR GAMING	5	October 2, 2020	I can't download 😣😭
Ben Potkins	1	October 2, 2020	Played for ages with previous developer, game transferred across and hasn't worked since, had contact from dev, but has made no difference, a shame as put lot of time into building up base and now gone. Very disappointing.
sonia buldaho	1	October 2, 2020	Its a waste of space you can't even get in on mobile!!

Wind Walker	1	October 2, 2020	Garbage downloaded on iPad then when I open it tells me the game is not compatable with my device waste of time

Norlisah Abdulrauf	1	October 3, 2020	"Tutorial upto level 5 is too long.. it felt like the game itself and i was only needed to be the ""button presser"".. not my kind of game.. verdict uninstall"
Steve Blackmore	2	October 3, 2020	keeps crashing not worth your time. it could be good if it didn't crash

Oscar Rotton	5	October 3, 2020	tried to play. not my cup of tea having to keep up the research.. just pressing buttons for no reason. thx for trying
MTFsoldier	1	October 3, 2020	Why do I need to click everything!? Edit: the tutorial you need to make it shorter it feels like your forceing my hand I think there should be an option to skip the tutorial or just 2 separate tutorials one for experienced players which tells them about the important mechanics and the 2nd one for people who don't know how to play strategy games
Tommy Bacon	4	October 3, 2020	Just had a few adverts pop up for this and noticed in one of them you use the voice sounds from Command and Conquers Red Alert 2, caught my interest but doesn't that surely break some copyright regulations? Anyway installed the game and it wasn't what I expected. Thought there would be a single player campaign driven story but its just another one of these base builder type games. Fun enough but just doesn't feel right for me. Sure others would love the online competitive nature though.
Hubert Gugnscki	5	October 3, 2020	It those not work for android phones plz fix
Ivan Luka Radobuljac	1	October 3, 2020	The gameplay is wrong and the graphics are bad
DAVID THOMAS	1	October 3, 2020	Doesn't work on huawei

Shaun Smith	5	October 3, 2020	Great game too play
Linda Cummins	5	October 3, 2020	Another generic game
DARWISY WAFFE	2	October 3, 2020	This Game Are Not History Accurate I'm don't Care About Anything about Pay2win Concepts But The Experience are Doesn't Worse My Time Perhaps Developer Make Some Historical Accurate Map Such as Stalingrad, Berlin And Many More The Most Worst Thing You Can't Play as Axis I Guess
John	1	October 4, 2020	1 star because the videos that lured me were not of the game.
Smith	1	October 4, 2020	False advertising, ad audio stolen from Command and conquer and game the was developed by Westwood studios and owned by Electronic Arts.
Jeffrey Clement	1	October 4, 2020	Why oh why do you put up ads that have nothing to do with your game. They obviously look way better then the game. And the game is nothing short of a dissapointment.
Richard Gooch	5	October 4, 2020	Its actually a pretty decent game barring the few bugs
Adam Khan	1	October 4, 2020	Dumb mobile game
Patrick Andres	1	October 4, 2020	The game should have balance among the players high level player must be banned from attacling newbies and low level players because they're ruining the fun they bullies newbies that make them quit the game. These kind of players must be punish i jope devs will listen to this because you will lose playees if these bullying of newbies keep going
Sam Cook	1	October 4, 2020	(BEWARE) So I have played this game for 4 months now and it was a great game. (BUT) The previous owners of this game have now (SOLD THE GAME) a few weeks back. The new company that has taken over have absolutely destroyed the game! now the game is full of bugs and glitches! It's a horrible experience to play. The customer service is now also dreadful! They are no help at all! I'd strongly advise to stay away from this game and dont waist your time or money on it.
Banana Split	5	October 4, 2020	The game is very fun. I have a few suggestions 1) The timer for stamina should be reduced because it take too long to wait. It take like a day to fully regenerate the stamina and that is too long. 2) Add more commander. The current commander does not enough to to fully command a five army camp troops. 3)Make the troops coupons easier to get. It actually kinda hard to get a new troop. Overall the game is really fun to play. Can't wait to what new update will bring.
Piotr L	1	October 4, 2020	Everything was fine until I saw in the campaign battle of Moscow the Russian character with the Polish flag on his arm. This is highly offensive as Soviet Russia was occupant of Poland as much as Nazis. Polish militia with polish flag armband would fight both soviets and nazis. Even after war when Soviets occupied Poland there was resistance against Soviet oppression and communist puppet state they have installed. For Poland WW2 really finished in 1989 and in 1993 the last soviet troops left.
Neil Quinn	1	October 4, 2020	Same as every other strategy game. Zero originality and zero thought. Also as every other one you get to a certain point and need to pay or lose. AVOID this waste of a game.
Douglas Dunn	5	October 4, 2020	There was a bit of a problem transitioning my account from the old game to the new game but it was worth it. The gameplay and controls are as good as always and the artwork and tank info is great too. Overall a definite five stars.
Wanz Cornetto	1	October 5, 2020	New update destroy it alk
Eric Koolbanis	5	October 5, 2020	Brilliant re-work of a classic mobile game style
Peter Ali	1	October 5, 2020	Wast of time not enough tutorial to show you how to proceed
Thomas Bravard	2	October 5, 2020	Unresponsive to commands, and a pay to play. Needs improvement.
Rob L	1	October 5, 2020	Why are you advertising with videos of the pc game men of war.. is your game that bad you cant actually use footage from it? This sort of advertising needs to be stamped out by google !!
Paul Kendrick	1	October 5, 2020	Absolutely nothing like the video ads, don't waste your time on bogus advertisement as this game is rubbish
Zakwan Hakim	5	October 5, 2020	✌️😁😁good
Raymark Mendoza	4	October 5, 2020	Still have some bugs but it is close to how it used to be, except for the officer skill upgrade
A Google user	1	October 5, 2020	Not ss the ads in the slightest, just another 'build an empire' game.
Damian Nogal	4	October 6, 2020	I was playing for a mont like crazy... I met awesome people we started alliance and I had fun... and know I updated a game and I CAN'T FAAAKING LOG IN! You have no idea how much angry I'm now... month of time into the drain :( thanks new developers.... Go to hell... Well it's little bit better now but still long way to go
dragon angel609	3	October 6, 2020	Good game needs money to get higher and better in the game also bugs in the game
macari law	1	October 6, 2020	tried to play, but game wasn't supported on any of my android devices, so why is it on google play
Duncan Edwards	1	October 6, 2020	So, Germany is renamed Raven and Japan is renamed Japan? Talk about racist BS. Recreate historical battles but rename Germany as we don't want to insult them but screw the Japanese? Is it because they aren't white? Rename one, rename all.
LANUN PUAKA	1	October 6, 2020	Before dev lilithgames. My account gone when changing dev
enzovirus	1	October 6, 2020	Do not download, ads use soundbites and units from Command and Conquer Red Alert 2 (one of the most love strategy games ever) but doesn't actually have them in game. A poor attempt to use items from Westwood Studios/EA.
Kevin Showers	1	October 6, 2020	This game won't stop spamming me to play it every ad from other games over and over yet I hate this type of game.
Arjun Sarin	5	October 6, 2020	NICE!

Dsg	1	October 8, 2020	It's just bad...
Lt General Goon	4	October 8, 2020	Typical money grab kinda game along the lines of ebony/evony/clash of clans but with a military feel.
Tristan Waller	1	October 8, 2020	1 hour in and still doing tutorial? Ridiculous game. Delete!
Suhaimie Mie gallery	5	October 8, 2020	Good
Ichika Sakura 初音の春風 ASMR	4	October 8, 2020	Good game but there are something which I don't like,it is hard to get units (at least for now),also the energy regain is too slow but overall it is a nice game
David Reid	1	October 9, 2020	The game was fun before now it's a joke you get attacked you land somewhere else they burn you no protection no chance of recovery nothing it's a joke now.. don't even try playing this game
Rafail Spari	4	October 9, 2020	How do you leave the alliance? I can't pass my leadership to my next one..... How to promote him?. Can't find the button
Lelin Bernard	1	October 9, 2020	Great graphics, great try, but very very boring game. Really hate that others can attack you but you can't retaliate. Also you can't make that many units. Talk about false advertising in the ad video that's just everywhere now
Paolo benoman	3	October 9, 2020	So many bugs after update the devs didnt do their job well
A Google user	2	October 9, 2020	no way back if you advance a level..end up being burnt every 5 minutes and no way out of it
Damage Games	4	October 10, 2020	A great game overall but I wish that you could reset your progress.
Mirosław Filus	1	October 10, 2020	I used to love that game, but last update nerfed officers and game is boring and to slow. Devs haven't gave any compensation for losing many officers levels. Now it all benefits pay to win players more than before. I'm from early beta test in this game and literally start losing interest in this game. WELL DONE.
Alan Krysiak	5	October 10, 2020	Put white light on Out of the box 4pm 8 0000000000000009pm
Anthony Pettinato	4	October 10, 2020	Just overall fun with excellent performance!
Andrew Hazelton	2	October 10, 2020	Tutorial takes forever, when can I play the game?? You are just met with a barrage of pop up message telling you to press upgrades. It's way too much info to take in so you are just aimlessly pressing buttons hoping to eventually get to play the game. It's not engaging or fun, I have given up as you won't let me play the game. Deleting...
Dmitrijs Linics	5	October 11, 2020	Awesome game. Please do some updates
Daelin Calahaisn	1	October 11, 2020	Nothing like it was advertised as
Adrian Cox	2	October 11, 2020	Stuck with upgrading base and it gets destroyed evertime I log in
Isaac_07	3	October 11, 2020	Downloaded 3 times still at the same progress and the mechanics is bad
Charlie McClone	5	October 11, 2020	Really good game my favourite game so far I would like to see ww1 planes as a fighting troop that would be fantastic
Box Monkey	5	October 11, 2020	It's a very fun game when you get in a alliance
DR HACKER 61	1	October 12, 2020	I spent money and a week playing this game i bought a new tablet I thought my account was already linked So I factory reset my old device and download the game on my new tablet first I spent 10nmins doing a tutorial which I already done then I switch to my main Gmail apparently it wasn't linked like wow all my work gone cus this game doesn't ask if you wanna link your account. The game is fun .
SCP Secret Laboratory MC	5	October 12, 2020	Ttf
Mike Quentel	1	October 13, 2020	Unable to start...hangs indefinitely. Android 8.1.0
Jaja G	2	October 13, 2020	Been enjoying this game for a couple of weeks but for an unknown reason, suddenly I can't play it on my phone (huawei mate 8). The game can't even launch. But I didn't have any issues playing it on my tablet (huawei m3) . Lucky I linked my Google account or I would've lost all my hard earned progress. But why though. Now I can't play it in the day when I don't have my tab. I've tried reinstalling it to my phone to no avail.
Donna LaPalme	4	October 13, 2020	My experience so far is fantastic
The Perry Gamer	5	October 13, 2020	No ads great game play

Larry C. Mbata	4	October 14, 2020	The game could use more improvement to keep people engaged, overall I like the game. But like most people I could also get bored if it becomes repetitive

Jack Coady	5	October 15, 2020	Great
solenostomous antimisanthropia	5	October 15, 2020	Nice game
James Magowan	2	October 15, 2020	Lots of marketing, but very formulaic game that is over complicated and overly procedural. I tried it twice, based on the amount of ads being pushed on it, but no joy.
O2 to breathe	5	October 15, 2020	The best game on earth, theres so much fake about this kind of controls a little tip: if u cant press anything in the assembly (like me) go on another app for like 5 seconds and come back!!
Sorbipher Miguel	1	October 15, 2020	Not my type of game.
Debbie	5	October 15, 2020	Its amazing this is how is top 1

Kieron clegg	5	October 15, 2020	Really good game and when i load it up it say update filed plz fix
nondisjunction repasts	5	October 15, 2020	I would play it every day!
Vas Lambrou	3	October 15, 2020	This would be a great game unfortunately there is no way to interact with the Devs. The amount of Racist and Homophomic insults in Global Chat is insane and you have no way of reporting these players.
ineluctability superaddition	5	October 15, 2020	The game is challenging and the plot is not bad.
Trevor Hewitt	5	October 15, 2020	I like this game but I can't wait to get in to real battles
cardiopuncture vinospiflication	5	October 15, 2020	Great
Joseph Leyk	1	October 16, 2020	"Another generic ""build a base, build some infrastructure"" oh wait, you gotta come back in 30 minutes so you can keep playing. I mean it's a good way to try to prevent people from being on thier phones for extended periods of time... But overall mobile platform games are sub par. Also the game is just too cartoonish. If you're going to make a WWII themed game at least have if somewhat historically accurate and show some emotional depth and poetic darkness to the world."
Abdullahi Osman	5	October 16, 2020	Enjoying so far. Great community base. You don't have to pay to win (so far). But I suspect the enjoyment factor will go down once it gains popularity.
the dutch	5	October 16, 2020	Yes what a game.. easy to get used to and no need to spend money if you don't want to.. plenty of people online.. and plenty of troops and missions to play.. campaign gets harder in time.. just upgrade and be patient...
Kestutis K.	1	October 16, 2020	Vertical screen in the strategy??? Sorry but no..
Dan G	1	October 16, 2020	It's not a strategy game at all. Just another rubbish game you just gave to endlessly keep clicking buttons
peter robinson	5	October 16, 2020	Great fun to play
Rose Eninew	5	October 16, 2020	This is a very good game
Shang Yi Chua	1	October 16, 2020	Not good
Ziyad Zaki	5	October 16, 2020	Lets play
Greg Mills	5	October 16, 2020	The game play is great, although I would like to see production times reduced especially on concrete, also a base shield would be great if possible like a 12hr shield, to protect base if player is going to be away for awhile. Apart from that fantastic game.
B0gfish	1	October 17, 2020	Totally worthless copy paste p2w whale game. Nothing new uninstalled.
Craig Paynter	1	October 17, 2020	Poor service when there is a problem nobody responds for weeks on end dont pay money on this game you dont get anything for it
jamie o'hare	1	October 17, 2020	Game is not to bad but defo not what is advertised, hate false advertising they lie to you before you Evan get the game stupid I wanted to play what was averted not this boring game
simone nicholson	5	October 17, 2020	Good
MoonBeam	5	October 17, 2020	Excellent work... perfect game...I like this situation and I will be there at house and
Gamal Hate	3	October 17, 2020	It looked like a good game at first then i noticed a 30 days speed up for science. I looked around the net and this is one of those game that has research lasting for months. I really hope im wrong but i doubt that. 3 stars cause its still fun
Ching Hwa Liew	3	October 17, 2020	The graphics are improved and the gameplay is great but after I completed chapter 13 there no more chapters left
Mohd Khairudin	5	October 17, 2020	Is best-!!!!you should downloaddd-!!!!
lukas rynkiewicz	1	October 17, 2020	Terrible. Just mindless clicking
Cal T	3	October 17, 2020	Game was enjoyable through the 1st chapter but once that first chapter is complete, the game goes very basic and no story, I also have the constant problem logging in, have been playing the game for a while and it is fun, but the constant inaccessibility is kind of annoying.
Chris Godfrey	1	October 17, 2020	So boring
Jon Cawte	1	October 17, 2020	Won't load properly, uninstalled/reinstalled it a couple of times and still zilch
Kyle Lane	2	October 17, 2020	The game its self is quite enjoyable its a shame tour community is extremely toxic
MARK JONES	5	October 17, 2020	Excellent strategy game for the whole family

Lolly King	5	October 18, 2020	Very fun
Ko Ko	5	October 18, 2020	hivbk
Ashley-John Thompson	1	October 18, 2020	bad
Matthew Wayling	1	October 18, 2020	"Do not play this game. Take a stand against the false advertising and fake 5 star reviews. There should be regulations in place to stop this behaviour. The adverts are nothing like the game. And you can see the 5 star fake reviews a mile off. They're all one sentence ""wow looks great. Many details."" just with different wording. DEVELOPERS! LEARN TO BE HONEST IN YOUR ADVERTISING AND STOP OFFERING INCENTIVES FOR FAKE 5 STAR REVIEWS. YOU'RE PART OF THE REASON MOBILE GAMING IS SO BAD."
Simon Young	2	October 18, 2020	What is this game I can't even get to the actual game I'm just stuck on the main page!
John paul young	3	October 18, 2020	Good game needs all of the bugs sorted though and there is plenty of them!! GET IT SORTED!!
Edwin Isurita	5	October 18, 2020	Masaya kahit walang load
Aiman Hakim	5	October 18, 2020	Pretty good
gair talboys	3	October 18, 2020	Very basic, graphics are not even remotely close to the advert and it does get extremely boring very quickly.
Lieutenant Taylor	1	October 19, 2020	Game not supported on this device. Try another device. Great answer but how am I meaning to do that when I only have one device. Every other game works perfectly apart from warpath. So much for a interesting game that doesnt even flipping work but yet still installs on your device. Anyone with a Samsung J6+ stay clear and save your time.
lqbt krkuo	5	October 19, 2020	Fun and eye-pleasing.
Максим Вадимович Елена Марченко	5	October 19, 2020	The game is fun to play, very good
Nikita Ale	1	October 19, 2020	I don't LIKE game only ad

Oatha Stobie	5	October 19, 2020	Love it!
mohamadali laughnan	5	October 19, 2020	A fun little game to play with my buddies.
Andrew Sayer	1	October 19, 2020	Tried downloading to an android tablet only to find that rather than have an incompatibility notice flash up telling me so it waited for me to waste time downloading and installing it . considering my tablet is only 6 months old i fi d that a little hard to believe
Sophie Mcgall	5	October 19, 2020	Great effort from the developing team. Nice job!
dbq xgbztl	5	October 19, 2020	I haven’t played such a fun game for a long time~
rivolver ocelot	3	October 19, 2020	Nothing to do....great game but it's only campaign and roaming the map. No events or other game modes.
mrvwok dchqv	5	October 20, 2020	a lot of cool levels
opoub dbsfh	5	October 20, 2020	Very interesting, I can't stop playing.
The Rustich	5	October 20, 2020	Super realistic and fun!
Jayden Evans	4	October 20, 2020	Strategic
DAN SAM	5	October 20, 2020	Super fun game! Just needs a few little touch ups and refinements.

Teerra Pilgram	5	October 20, 2020	The style of painting looks refined
Darren P	1	October 20, 2020	Awful, nothing like the video advert shown on YouTube.
Danny Carter	1	October 20, 2020	Trash
pobhzf yne	5	October 20, 2020	Like this game, it's so much fun!
itianna doniso	5	October 20, 2020	Some of the battle scenes are really realistic!
tgsfqd iwi	5	October 20, 2020	The game is fun and easy to get started
dfz iyzzpb	5	October 20, 2020	Simple to get started, send a short break
Delquan Fidock	5	October 20, 2020	this game was incredibly fun!
dwlxgz diu	5	October 20, 2020	The most addictive game in the world.
Shawki Mcgairl	5	October 20, 2020	So addictive lol
Naresh Gopalkrishnan	1	October 20, 2020	It crashes my phone when I tried to open the app.. It happened twice, my phone restarted again and again.. Very disappointed 😕
Ivan Rauch	1	October 21, 2020	Boring game
Antony Pitt	1	October 21, 2020	To the developers...are you so shameless to the fact that the adverts to your games use stolen voice assets from Command and Conquer Red Alert 2? You think because the game is old we wont notice? And also you have used the GDI logo from the Original Command and Conquer in your clearly fake game footage? I wont believe the well its advertisers who make the demos we dont have anything to do with it. You are paying them you are in charge unless you deliberetly told them to make fake gameplay
Yousif Youkhana	5	October 21, 2020	Everyone has their taste in gaming, not everyone is down for this game unless you really like full strategic game like this. Other than that the game has minor glitches nothing major where you're going to quit. Pay to win thats optional in this game as every other game. But it does not force you to upgrade next or do whatever.. with real money. Great game in my opinion.
G	3	October 21, 2020	Do you like easy games like Farmville? Do not play this. Good tactical controls, good overall strategic planning required. Change the file select to sort newest to oldest, not the other way. Allow us to set any given folder as the default screenshot selection folder. Better group selection would be useful, being able to save preset groups even more so. 4 stars if you fix the group selection issue 5 stars if you make the ability to gain gold cards possible
Keith Clarke	4	October 21, 2020	The game itself is ok but when you see the adverts it shows something different from the game I understand the structure of the game , run around collecting materials and shoot get very boring also waiting time to get get energy all down to money again
Mark Smith	3	October 21, 2020	The advertising for this game is very misleading.
Charles parker	5	October 21, 2020	l need to be working on war
Gabriel Zabas	5	October 21, 2020	This game is very different to other games I don't play that much mobile games but this one is a great game
David Skinner	1	October 22, 2020	Full of idiots and babbling kids
Fernando Pernica	1	October 22, 2020	Couldn't even open it...loads and then stays in screen a while. If I touch the screen, the game closes.
Matt Keating	1	October 22, 2020	Why even bother making ads if it doesn't depict a single aspect of your game?
Lior Abel	3	October 22, 2020	"If this were the first of its kind and I weren't utterly sick of ""attack other players' bases"" games, it might have been fun. But it's far from first. In fact, it's nothing more than a reskin of a million others just like it. Hard pass."
my Mcintyre	5	October 22, 2020	The game is grate it is enjoyable and In all really good
HOGZ_reptic _	5	October 22, 2020	Amazing game love to play it all the time
HASSAN DRAGA	2	October 22, 2020	unfortunately, I uninstall this game after spending 1h in the tutorial.. it's seem will never finish and no way to stop. also this game didn't support auto rotate screen. but I like the graphics.
Danny Ako	1	October 22, 2020	Game itself is 5 star but give 1 cos you people asking how much i spend on games and asking what i am willing to spend is wrong
HenryGames	4	October 22, 2020	Hey, your game just gets better and better by the minute, but there is a problem... I joined an alliance and then I relized I had a coupon, I wnt to the chest page and it was legit broken, I could not press nothing, and another thing is that when your relocating your base, the truck keeps stopping, then going... 2 minutes later... Takes a long pause on moving, nack to moving, like its annoyong, my units are like wakting there for like an hour. Still a hood hame so for my rate, I give it another⭐
Tiew Yongsoon	1	October 22, 2020	WHY THIS GAMES NOT SUPPORTED ON BLUESTUCK SOFTWARE ,WHY?
Jackles N.	4	October 22, 2020	The troop reload need less time to wait...
leonard borja	3	October 22, 2020	Edit: is this still continuing??? Cause there's also warpath:Liberation... Really confused on which ahould focus cause i msg at the fb page... They were confused and surprise as to how i can still play the old one... I showed them some pictures and they say that they will get back at me... But until now there's nothing...
David McClellan	1	October 23, 2020	couldnt get game to load
Jacob_ Playz	1	October 23, 2020	I have upgraded my phone to a Nokia 5.3 5g and I can download the game but it says the download was incomplete so I can't play the game now. I tried uninstalling it and redownloading it but still doesn't work. This is one of my favourite games but now I can't even access it. Shambles
Torden Alderson	1	October 23, 2020	What a load of drivel. There are much more interesting and less confusing games of this genre out there. This game is dull and the graphics are tiny and hard to read what's going on. I think it's just a rewrite over an old engine tra sposed badly with no thought to the player. I wouldn't bother with it but give it a go and see I'm right
Wenter In Faer	3	October 23, 2020	Is that Pattison?
Chris Colasanti	5	October 23, 2020	I got. But. .

Craig Oconnor	3	October 23, 2020	Every time I try 2 load the game up it freezes and closes the app so I can not play it it's been doing this for a few days now
mansewel lompat	1	October 24, 2020	Not satisfied with resources gold, team war not have rules in war n not have event.. Need to wait a long time to build soldier, hat of troop already finished.
Saing Ambo Channel	1	October 24, 2020	Not fun for Malaysian player, take a long time to create troops after already finished hat... So, bad...
ALK TEAM2015	1	October 24, 2020	So bad player strategy when not have rule in war..be ally betrayed by ally, so could have confirmation that really be ally not just dealing in chat, then their betray us.. really not fun..
dewakayangan KayanganPutra	1	October 24, 2020	Need to upgrade more interesting from developer about this game, ally must confirm in system being ally, not just in chat then betray each other. Not so fun, but so funny strategy game.. just play mobile legend so fun..
Lewis Jennings	1	October 24, 2020	Only giving one star to this garbage game beware all new players I started yesterday I come back the next day my City's gone troops are gone just a waste of time you should at least provide new players with a shield so don't get taken over the first day
jay coleman	1	October 24, 2020	Spent ages downloading only to try to open the game and it says down load failed u lost me before I could even start very poor
culture Dee	5	October 24, 2020	Great gameplay and the graphics and illustrations are top marks really nice 👌
jvruss	3	October 24, 2020	Its a pretty good game, but to get new and improved army units you rely on a random draw in hopes you will get the unit you need to combine with another one to assemble the new unit, also there has got to be a better way to get components than there is, and maybe get more for rewards
KUHAN LIM	3	October 24, 2020	Good game but one problem.Why does the game say upadte failed,try again and when i try it loads and loads until i cannoy enter the game?
T_Rye420	1	October 24, 2020	Lost my linked account. And so i messaged the devs no reply they dont care they just want your money.
Ngelanna Jerrly	1	October 24, 2020	Bored

Garry Kelly	5	October 24, 2020	really good game, good play style
Devil4sure	1	October 24, 2020	Cant even play on Bluestacks or my Tablet :(
Barrie Tamkin	2	October 24, 2020	Yet another clan based game were you build and upgrade kill monsters on a map and get farmed by super clans. Only this time its ww2 not pirates or space ships, Vikings or zombies.
Aaron Butt	2	October 25, 2020	Boring
Nicholas L	1	October 25, 2020	Terrible..only money counts..in the game..no money no talk

Patrick MC Phillip	5	October 26, 2020	Amazing game
David Churchard	4	October 26, 2020	Love the game but players need to be split on different servers if you are European you just get wiped out by Asian players while you sleep

Lazy guy wachting YT	5	October 27, 2020	!WARNING! THIS GAME IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS. I have been playing this game for a few weeks now and still don't find myself getting bored despite playing almost everyday. The game is very easy to learn, the alliance system is very good and the game is smooth. But most importantly, it doesn't shove ads in your face, a big plus. I would recommend this game to others if the ads for it didn't straight up lie, other than that though, it's excellent.
Bill Soroka	1	October 27, 2020	Not a great game

Marcus CHUA	4	October 27, 2020	Overall this is avery good game, im very enjoy playing it without any annoying advertisements. Howevere, there are a lot of things which need to improved. For example, a rarity filter will be very useful at the equipment/unit page.

Harrison Chapple	5	October 27, 2020	Great social gaming platform, amazing details, very easy to use. The best thing is the lack of waiting time for building upgrades. I've always ended up deleting these sorts of games within a day or so, but a week on I am still thoroughly addicted!
Micheal Tremayne	5	October 27, 2020	Game is excellent. As a game in progress highly recommend. Could do with a report offensive player postings though.

Greg Parnell	5	October 27, 2020	Yeah best game I've ever played in my 20 plus years of playing games like this. I'm coming up to my a month or so of playing this game. Haven't paid money to get things like you with other games like this. You can get enough gold by looking for it once the fog clears. I've gotten like 12k gold and heaps of rss. I can't put the game down its really addictive. But there some issues. Like, there could be a separate folder in chat column for alliance members. Another for others. Thanks.

John Murfin	5	October 27, 2020	Great fun you can easily get addicted, only issue really is stamina takes way to long to recover, needs to be reduced dramatically, otherwise good fun probably the best out there.

Kris Bayly	1	October 27, 2020	Takes to long to upgrade and collect resources. Raven is to strong. You units are destroyed. The officer upgrade needs work. Alliance parameters are bad. I want to add a village. Or attack my enemies But i cannot even as a top dog.

Shadow Double	3	October 27, 2020	I from alliance ndk from nasville why late not fair la
Bart Black	4	October 27, 2020	Lags quiet a bit during larger scale battles, where your units will disappear on screen, and get destroyed by other players while you log out and back in to fix it, other than this though is one of the best games I've ever played of its type. The previous update made it harder for f2p players, but hoping the new update will fix that. That's why it missed out on a five star review.
Ion Aurelian	5	October 27, 2020	Great game is what y was loking for.
Tomoruin • 50 years ago	4	October 27, 2020	You can play this game endlessly making its gameplay fun and addictive

Tandrell Freeman	5	October 27, 2020	Great game, but give us more stamina or reduce the time to get more in game. That's the only issue I have with this game. Give it a go, no money spending needed.
Mick Stephens	5	October 27, 2020	Enjoyable
Gary Burgoine	5	October 27, 2020	its addictive

Azmir Abdul Aziz	4	October 27, 2020	Don't join LVT. They ll stab your back
B J Robson	5	October 27, 2020	Good game, not pay to win. After playing thieving PTW games like War Robots this is really refreshing to play a good game that doesn't just want to rob you blind.
Jasdeep Chaggar	4	October 27, 2020	Great game, not perfect. The only think that would make this game better would be a PVP match similar to campaign missions. There is a steep learning curve on the game imo. But when it clicks it gets really fun. I would say the game is not pay to win, but I'm only level 12.
Rav Singh	5	October 27, 2020	A fun and engaging game. Must try
leandras brick86	4	October 27, 2020	👍

Jose Valle	3	October 27, 2020	Good game. The only bad part is the high level bullies who push around smaller alliances cause they can.

Duke Del Castillo	1	October 27, 2020	So sad to hear after you spend some money and time playing this awesome game. Your country is being blocked and was told by dev to install a diiferent game and start at the beginning. Do you know what it feels like Your robbing money and false hope to consumers. We will push through with filing a claim on this matter so you cant do robbing others money.

cebsf	5	October 28, 2020	Very good so far
anita regan	4	October 28, 2020	It is a nice little game, but I think there's too many claim rewards which is used for upgrades which to me slows the game down. That brings me to the next point.... The game needs little spin offs. I have only scratched the surface of the game, so it might still surprise me.
Chris O'Brien	4	October 28, 2020	Can anyone else get into game after update ? Tried reboiting etc, screen just locks up.

Trevor Sheldon	1	October 28, 2020	"Updates destroy your game. ""Delete and uninstall"" how does that help? Not all of us backup our accounts to Google. Me and my friend have had this issue now. And I'm using a new high end phone it's down to poor software and lack of development"

John Loveridge	3	October 28, 2020	Good game until the latest update game won't load and no one has got back to me from support 😒 😑 😤
Chris Gore	4	October 28, 2020	The game is very enjoyable with a good progression arc. You can purchase items to upgrade faster but there really is no need for the casual gamer. Units are diverse and the game is easy to use and navigate.
the third stupid idiot	5	October 28, 2020	It's a good game but you need to be able to allowed to make a new game
Phil Lngridge	5	October 28, 2020	👍
Alex Wagner	4	October 28, 2020	Good game but I ran out of room in units storage. I can't upgrade anymore of my units because there is alot of units I can't upgrade. Is there away to get rid of them?
sam hurford	1	October 28, 2020	Come back find my base gone everything and aint been attacked and if so by what its not an online game
Eugene Quinto	5	October 28, 2020	Good game
Alexis Alex	3	October 28, 2020	Not bad but once you reach a certain level it becomes hard to progress and there is a lack of action
Charlie Waterson	1	October 28, 2020	Useless update. Really enjoyed playing game for months and was making some good progress. Then update came out and I can't log in anymore. Beautiful.🥴
Th3kempest	4	October 28, 2020	It's a good game, helped me find entertainment for the past month, I do have a problem with the update today, the constant censoring, it is a very sensitive system, and I have trouble understanding my teammates, or anyone for that matter, I would recommend turning down the sensitivity, or making a way to turn off censoring completely for people who don't care too much about foul language, etc. Keep up the good work!
mark whittle	5	October 28, 2020	Interesting
Robert	1	October 28, 2020	Fix this game guys, it's a shame as it used to be good before the update. Download failed keeps popping up when trying to load the game.

Ken Mcadam	5	October 28, 2020	Awesome
Jamie Newman	1	October 28, 2020	Unfortunately every update brings more misery. Lost account twice not again. Don't waste your time.
Souljah Gurl	4	October 28, 2020	Its a good game, makes one rethink their strategic moves, trooper choice and placement of troops when on the field or in campaign. Would be awesome if ammunition supply in reward drops increased...as its needed to upgrade units
Afr090	3	October 28, 2020	Meh
Chosen One	5	October 28, 2020	Excellent
Jade Bassett	2	October 28, 2020	Good game however its now been ruined by being unable to talk to your alliance without almost everything being censored, even the word freedom gets censored its absolutely stupid. How can we work together when we can't even talk
Kasim S	5	October 28, 2020	Yo it's proper good game yeah. You can like fight other peoples bases and that you get me yeah bruv. So it a mad game and u can chat with your mates

Daniel Whittle	5	October 28, 2020	Great
Zia Fehrenbach	1	October 28, 2020	Game update broke the game. Can no longer log in. Advice from support has actually made the situation worse, with many losing their accounts because they were told to uninstall and reinstall after the new update and are no longer able to get in. Support is silent on Facebook despite complainants here being directed there. Tragic outcome for a very promising game.
no name	1	October 28, 2020	giving this a one because now that it has updated I can't log in or play on this game, so how I look at it is we got your money now piss off, erm no don't think so.

Christopher Skerritt Elliott	4	October 28, 2020	Great game, only shame you cant help each other with resources. Might make it a bit quicker to grow, after lvl 15 resources are hard to come by

Dexter / Jenson Bushell	4	October 28, 2020	Okay graphics , gameplay is slightly confusing and a bit off with it throwing random things in your face , but when you get used to it , it's alright.
Robert Scott	1	October 28, 2020	I used to love this game and was going to give it 5 stars yesterday, until the latest update which is when it stopped working. Since the latest update it keeps saying download failed. I've uninstalled the game and reinstalled it multiple times and it still doesn't work and keek getting same message. I emailed the developers and haven't had a reply, so going to give it 1 star, only because of how I loved it previously otherwise I would have given it no stars based on current experience.
Raymond Chin	1	October 28, 2020	why my game cant update? i already reinstall but still cant update n play. pls fix this asap.

Matthew Hansen	1	October 29, 2020	"Been playing the game for about a month, during last update the app would not load afterwards. Meanwhile another Alliance wiped out all of our bases during that time. So I finally get the app to update properly and within 24 hrs here I sit with another ""download failed"" error. This time I cannot get the error to clear. It's now been 2 days and the app is still broken, waste of alot of time."
Perfume Hauzz	5	October 29, 2020	This game is really making me into WW2.there so many great thing I can do in this game.But i hope there will be more officers.I also want a new updates such as giving unused troops to another player cause that's going to be so much fun.But keep doing the good job!
Stuart Johnstone	4	October 29, 2020	Good
Jessie John Purugganan	1	October 29, 2020	why is it the player from phil does'nt allow you to play our account? we spend money and time for this and then you advise us to restart a new game just like that pathetic
matt bale	5	October 29, 2020	Great game
Allan Chamberland	1	October 29, 2020	I downloaded the new update and now the game won't load , really disapointing especialy when I have spent money on this game. I emailed them about this issue and guess what.... yup no reply.
Alice wolfy Edwards	5	October 29, 2020	Exemplary game. A true credit to the developers. Really enjoy playing this. Mad love and respect to all developers and their families. Stay safe ladies and gents.
Fhantom RG	5	October 29, 2020	Nice games
Bianca Jayne Jackson	1	October 29, 2020	Just to let the owners and updaters of this game. Ever since the new Update it keeps crashing every time I zoom out. The updates of the game seem to be getting worse.
Andrew Kirton	5	October 29, 2020	Great game...
LEFT TRIANGLE	5	October 29, 2020	Its nice, not like rise of kingdom, u got wiped and restart build troop again, This game is different, simple one

MOHD FADLI SHAM ENCEK DEWET	5	October 29, 2020	This is so cool !!!!
Selow Lee	3	October 29, 2020	Officer mission can have option of auto-assign which save time. The game will often delay for showing the right status while doing resource combat
gary bradley	1	October 29, 2020	Really poor update My response was if I encounter any issues.... The update to fix bugs won't download, I can't get on the game. I've tried everything

Jamie Rowbottom	4	October 29, 2020	Back working great game
C DT	4	October 29, 2020	Since your recent update I cant load the game or do anything on the app, please find a solution to this as I'm really enjoying this game
Karol Kryża	1	October 29, 2020	Devs are lying and stealing oxygen living pests, they only interested in your money, and not your enjoyment from the game and when you fed up with it and at least trying to get some of your money back they will do you twice over so you never gonna try do it again, disgrace you are wonder games, nothing wonder about this definitely
Mike Chunguski	5	October 29, 2020	Wonderful game. If it's possible, I would like to see an option for turning off auto attack, this would definitely help out a lot when we're helping an alliance we're on good terms with. Or an option to add other alliances onto a friendly/ally list and then our units wouldn't randomly attack their units (of course, the alliance would need an option to approve to be allies with an alliance).
Gavin Nixon	1	October 29, 2020	This game is so repetitive and boring 😴 Most of the game is so hard to understand, and I feel like I'm just winging it. Even being in an alliance doesn't help because they don't allow you to help and develop because of either a lack of patience and have too much time on their hands, or are just write childish bile😒
Iain Knight	4	October 29, 2020	Oct 27th update. Broke the game. Stuck in loading screen. Can not get in the game. Very dissapointed.☹
Maulawi Tajudin	1	October 30, 2020	Boring game

Jonathan Lynn	5	October 30, 2020	Working now... all. Good. Thank you
Henry Van Gameren	1	October 30, 2020	"Seems like a fun game at first but it's full of bugs and annoyances. Upgrade paths are confusing and grind to a halt after a month of playing. I have team members that have been playing for months and are only now just understanding how to play. I gave it 1 star because I hope to get the attention of support. They are not responding to my requests. I do get standard ""bot"" responses, but that just makes me more angry."
BeardedOne	5	October 30, 2020	Great game but since the new update its just stuck on the loading screen, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still won't load.

Jenny Pirrie	1	October 30, 2020	Was a 5* game until update. This is the second time the game won't load & they choose to do this update in the middle of a showdown. Money spent has now been wasted & in my opinion that is entirely the point, to get us to spend more money. Won't be playing again
Archangelz 2106	5	October 30, 2020	It's nice but I'm having a problem now trying to start up the game. It lags out.
Samuel Atkinson	4	October 30, 2020	Great game but the registration of when you click the button hardly work and ruins the game... sort it out... other than that everything else is awesome.

Kelvin Lee	1	October 31, 2020	Hi, I prefer to gave this game 5 star, this is a nice war game for me. But after yesterday system update few hours, and make the app broken, can download but can't update. I try whole night till I am sleeping. Just now try again, uninstall and install again, still te same. The system show can't download properly. May I know the development can give a good reason for me? Tq

Clare Crook	4	November 3, 2020	Love the set up of the game but joined the wrong alliance by accident by tapping the wrong button . I've managed to leave the ss alliance but can't change back to the allied forces can anybody tell me how I can do this
Hafiz Yanzly	1	November 4, 2020	This game is very good but so disappointed everytime update coming. You guys said its only take 3 hours. But then you guys add more 2 hours. Yet again add more 1 hours. I mean come on,you guys do update on important events day. I'm very frustrated. You guys should do your work more properly.
Troy Loud	1	November 4, 2020	Had a update make people miss out on some game changing rewards then expect hundreds if not thousands to send in bug reports just to get it
Jonathan Richard	1	November 5, 2020	Once again, new update, game won't load. Cleared cache, Uninstaller, reinstalled, game updates then freezes. Closed the game, reopened and freezes again. Uninstaller and reinstalled a second time and still nothing.
Wayne Hunter	1	November 5, 2020	Don't bother, new players are unwelcome
jay zacharewicz	1	November 5, 2020	I have deleted this game, never going to dl anything from this dev, there problem responses are automated and they never bother with bug fixes. S.h.i.t. pure s.h.i.t
sky infinity	1	November 5, 2020	Update to slow slow so boring game need cash one and map to small all upgrades one need untill 2 or more day so so boring game pls don play one cash game
Adam Mcneill	1	November 5, 2020	So many same format with diff graphics

Paweł Cieslikowski	5	November 6, 2020	Awesome game
Shad0wsS0ldier	1	November 6, 2020	Idk, why not
Robert M	1	November 6, 2020	Lasted all of 1 minute playing this game when presented with a www 2 lady officer wearing a mini skirt, come on guys, if your advertising this game with real wwii tanks etc. Be a little respectful, guys geees 🙄
Stephen J.	1	November 6, 2020	Agree with the others. Why change a perfect or great model for what you have now. Please considervwhat we are saying. Ive left....but might come back if fixed. Sad was great.
Michael Grenier	1	November 6, 2020	Fun game, but since the update on the 26th, I can't launch the game anymore. Keeps saying failed download when I launch it. Even after multiple, multiple uninstals and reinstals still can't load the game. After waiting a week, I tried to reinstall the game and went through a very long package download still to no avail. Download keeps failing after 99.99% package download. This really sucks. And I cleared Google Play's cache and my phone's cache. Still nothing. I'm done trying
Rolf Turatus	1	November 6, 2020	Did not work on Samsung tablet, had to delete the game
Bamba Siaka	3	November 6, 2020	The new update is working now!
Avecenix 85	1	November 6, 2020	The design of this game quitely good. But honestly if you not invest some real money in it u will gonna lose in power race. The raven bonus for killing it very small sometime not really worth it. Energy replenish rate too damn slow.. Unless u buy some gold.. And more the currency rate for buying any purchase is really not unfair.. For Malaysian it really cost nearly RM400.00 for the big one gift.. There is no bonus for destroying enemy base and quitely annoying. Just play build and farm..
Lil Turtle	5	November 6, 2020	Loki it is a good game and the bugs that u say are bad that is got to do with ur device so shut up
Greg Wheare	3	November 6, 2020	Thank you for fixing the problem . I can now play the game on my phone
beh heng yao	4	November 6, 2020	Its pretty ok but if you remove the limit of the contribution reserch because its very slow to get points (alliance) and there is a visual bug where you almost kill raven but my troop will not attack that raven but i can collect the resource
nightz stream	4	November 7, 2020	Really enjoyed play this game 😍. The gameplay and graphic are awesome. No pay to win feature. But only trouble is war setting. Hope you can make forced stop button. Sometime im confused where is heavy tank and medium tank when war, so please add like a colour belom trooper. Like army 1 is grean mark, army 2 is yellow mark. So its will be more easy to move the troop to perfect spot. Anyway the graphic and perfomenced are 10/10. And last thing, please add zoom out/in button. Thank you 😁.
Riley Rayment	5	November 7, 2020	I would love it if we could have Eather more barracks or more barrack levels I would really love to see mor barracks I like that we have 5 barracks but I think 7-10 barracks would be very nice because then we can have more possible troop combos and stronger attacks and easier campaign missions and more power to use in combat. Thank you for your time and hard work and for taking the time to read and consider my idea keep up the hard work. 😁😁😁😁👍👍👍
Anna Prescott	3	November 7, 2020	2 stars taken off for the fact that when u buy something u will never have any gold left as it takes it all away with one purchase
Haris Izzuddin	1	November 7, 2020	Hi there developer been waiting for this game available for my device and I was very happy as I download it and when I'm open this it say that my phone isn't compatible with this game version Is it the play store fault or this game itself a problem mind telling me what happen?
Sally Best	4	November 7, 2020	I played this game a while ago and its come along way the isdues back then were bad now there good it seems like a good game now
Tai Kim Siong	1	November 7, 2020	Can't download the data package
Samuel Le Jossec	1	November 7, 2020	I installed this game after seeing a Facebook ad that had the same gameplay and sounds as Command and conquer. The game was nothing like that and was actually quite boring and generic.
gamerzxage 231	1	November 7, 2020	No it there isn't availability for my phone versions :( phone version is vivo 1606
Trevor Walker	3	November 7, 2020	It could use a upgrade badly But otherwise it's a good role playing game
Joe Elliott	1	November 7, 2020	You guys cant make it compatble with tablets!!!! What a bunch of idiots you guys are!
Harvey Hall	5	November 8, 2020	Very good, excellent game but I feel as though the unit types are very limited
Jason Fletcher	3	November 8, 2020	Its enjoyable at first, but it's a blatant pay to progress game once your past a certain level.
Nick Young	4	November 8, 2020	Nice owhhh
Green Galaxy YT	5	November 8, 2020	Sooooo soooo soooo good!!!!
Darren Shackleton	4	November 8, 2020	You need brains to play this game, loads of fun.
abolfazl HN	5	November 8, 2020	Nice
Paul Waddilove	1	November 8, 2020	Sorry I've really tried over this past 2mths to understand the overall gameplay, but your game is just too damn complicated. It's happened to loads of people that I've connected with on the game too, they're giving up because it's just so difficult to understand.
om nom	1	November 8, 2020	RUBBISH it wouldn't let me load the game the app closes on the loading page )-:
Koo Enrique	5	November 8, 2020	Technical support team really did well in their jobs, they responded to my bug log in last time and have a short update. Gameplay is fun especially with the drawing chests function, it's really special comparing to other games.
Mark Bradley	5	November 9, 2020	I like the game warpath

Chris Watts	4	November 9, 2020	Great game.. nice visuals... lots of different missions, sub missions. Fantastic gameplay... lots of daily missions and long term goals. These guys have done a really good job. not buggy. would be nice if there was a 180 degree screen rotation for those with power ports at the bottom of their devices.
Darren Wait	4	November 9, 2020	Since update it won't play game grrrrrr
Andre OHare	5	November 9, 2020	Awesome game I would recommend it to others to play it five stars i give it

ZeD FLaMeZz	5	November 10, 2020	Hello first of all I would like to say from all of my friends playing the game they have found it really fun and so have I. Second I think it's great that the devs have replayed to all of the reviews I have seen. I think this game will do well and definitely could become my favourite mobile game. Sincerely Josh
Clare Jarlett	1	November 10, 2020	I can even play it when I get in it says try another divice horable.
Kalen Johnson	5	November 10, 2020	War games are fun
FishyOnMe	1	November 10, 2020	Game was not supported on my device, not sure why you would release a game that was not supported for modern androids.
Damien Rangel	1	November 10, 2020	Allowed me to download the game; however, when I started the game, it told me it wouldn't work on my device (Galaxy s5). Really got my hopes up.

Arturo Vega	1	November 10, 2020	Downloaded game and it won't load past the startup screen. What a joke.
KIL Wakk0	1	November 10, 2020	It ask permission to access my camara, why the bloody hell yall want access to my camara, for advertising purpose or to spy on your customers, its very stupid of your game asking permission, i had file a report with google C.S. department , i took screen shots and sent it to them , this is a game not spy on youre customers
Edgar Espinoza	1	November 10, 2020	Very long tutorial, I uninstall after CHAPTER 5 while thr tutorial is running
OG CHI	1	November 10, 2020	Why don't you game makers make something original for once this is complete and utter trash just like the rest of these level up games that you have to sit and wait or pay for how can this game have 3400 four-star ratings and it just came out today 30 minutes ago
Dragnox Gaming	1	November 10, 2020	I was pre registered for the game and then I downloaded it to say my device can not support the game like why I waited so long ;-;
[ГРУ-П / КГБ - SCP] AI_VIRUS	5	November 10, 2020	WORLD WAR II Edit: Bruh, I downloaded it on my android phone and it says it's doesn't support this device lol
Fireman5580	1	November 10, 2020	I had a lot of hope for this game after seeing the ads but I can't even experience the game because it crashes on startup. It will show the loading screen then some foreign Text will pop up then the screen will go black. After a minute the same foreign text will show and the loading screen pops back up and it repeats. Very sad that I got my hopes up for nothing.
Kaiser Ryn	1	November 10, 2020	Soon as i saw the Random reward cards i uninstalled. Just another EA Gambling scam type of game.
anDREAM :p	1	November 10, 2020	does not let me get in the game i waited a month and i cant play the game im going to unistall it and never play it again
James Seward	1	November 10, 2020	"Downloaded this game to only findout after a msg pop up saying ""This game is not compatiable!"
B V	1	November 10, 2020	Where is my old account? Where are the money I spent? Is it how you do business? Keep releasing new apps, after soft launches? Do not install it, do not spend it. You never know when devs will decide to shut down the app, and release new one.
Robert Thomas	5	November 10, 2020	Love it make a warpath 2
Jason	5	November 10, 2020	Fantastic game! A lot of fun to play. The graphics of the game is great.. The game play is very addictive. I can't stop playing it.. I highly recommend it. 10/10
axton schear	4	November 10, 2020	So far this game is pretty good the cut scenes look great and the game play is simple yet fun
james burke	1	November 10, 2020	It will not allow me to change my username to jamesburke01 it even says jamesb has illegal characters.
Jesse Demico	1	November 10, 2020	Doses not work on all phones
crazy doggo	1	November 10, 2020	Is that it??? i waited months for THIS??? Your game is so... SO... Boring... Its full of these boring games these days...but seriously, this was BAD, I need a TV show to fully describe how bad it is,I feel sick,Maybe next time you create a game you really add somthing new to it, you didn't need silly childish voice actors... Its a WW II game! You need to give more freedom,Maybe its better for you to take a look at Empires and allies and see how they do it where you can truly control your units.
Elijah Cooper	1	November 10, 2020	Won't open and Google virus scan says app does unusual behavior 🤔 🙄 so, I trust Google on this one
Otis Mattsey	4	November 10, 2020	I feel the game is good for people who are more into simulator ww2 games. I'd like to make this rating be 3.5 but 4.0 is fine. The graphics are good and a good concept, just not so much for me. Good job game developers you did well.
Joe McBallz	4	November 10, 2020	I've played this for a while now and i love it. The graphics, story and everything seems amazing, but my only problem is that it's too much like Rise Of Kingdoms in my opinion, i would've preferred it to be more single player etc. But other that that i love it, looking forward to what's coming ^^
Ivo Plays	5	November 10, 2020	The game is pretty good didn't think much of it at the start but i like the game
Avarice Gaming	5	November 10, 2020	How the hell have people been playing this for days when it literally just came out today? Stop whining, don't like it, don't play it
David Spoon	5	November 10, 2020	Good
Benjamin Angel	1	November 10, 2020	"Ok first of all, what a disappointment; second of all, why is it saying ""your device is not compatible"", if my device isn't compatible then how come the play store let me install you in the first place?? I really hope y'all over at lilith get this fixed."
SaVaGeDOGE Gaming	5	November 10, 2020	Really fun game I'm playing it 2 days before veterans day. SO HAPPY VETERANS DAY!!!!!! KEEP UP THE UPDATES
Michael Moreno	1	November 10, 2020	Right when I open the app Chinese letters pop up and it crashes. Is this a cheap Chinese knock off of something?
سید مهدی موسوی فرگی	1	November 10, 2020	"Why after installing app says ""my phone do not support "" ??!!?"
AcemanX Ace Wolf™	1	November 10, 2020	Won't even play on Note 20 Ultra

F1RE Flie	5	November 10, 2020	Amazing game, great graphics as well.
Fleegle31	5	November 10, 2020	Great game so far but the research is wayyy to slow
Katie Rendleman	2	November 10, 2020	Not what I was thinking it was going to be when I pre registered. Just another copy cat, plenty of games just like it.
fadli rahman	1	November 10, 2020	I stuck while create barrack2. Try uninstall still started at the same problem
{ACCOUNT BANNED}	5	November 10, 2020	This game is just wonderful I haven't had any problems with the ads at all and also it's time consuming asf rlly would recommend this game
minecraft is life	5	November 10, 2020	Pretty good for thinking where and what to do.
skully001 yt	5	November 10, 2020	Uhh pual didnt this game just come out
maximus89	1	November 10, 2020	not good. i uninstalled
Aprio Paradox	5	November 10, 2020	Certainly the game has a good gameplay i seen the other people complaining about bugs which i haven't seen yet, i just hope the cloud server don't delete my save though if it does i will reduce the star.
Steven Hartman	4	November 10, 2020	Good so far.. just can't figure out how to change my city. Stuck on Bilbao, Spain.
Matei	5	November 10, 2020	I really love it. How can I find the artwork of characters in full size?
Haytam elmokhlice	5	November 10, 2020	Great game, ilv it
Haris Khan	5	November 10, 2020	Good game
ǝɔɐɹoH ƃᴉlɔɐq	1	November 10, 2020	This game sucks and the ads falsely advertised. The ads showed this game as a clone of company of heros when the game play is nothing near it. It really sucks because all these mobile games false advertise as an rts when they obviously aren't. Why don't you actually spend time making an rts game instead of lying to us.
Reece Wilmott	1	November 10, 2020	Im sorry i love this game but i bought the starter pack with the flying General for 1.50 and it didnt work and then I purchased it again and it took money out account can you please sort it out asap and give me 1.50 woth of ammunition or something and I'll leave a good opinion on the game because i do love it but today 10 minutes ago this happend please help me out guys, and i wouldn't put this on the review page but i couldn't find a report page, I would be a highly paying customer
Charley Hammil	5	November 10, 2020	Wow.. Just a good game
Bebo Gaming	5	November 10, 2020	It is EXCELLENT 👍👌 I can play it all the day
Mark Purcell	2	November 10, 2020	Downloaded this game and started playing immediately. The graphics are really good, but unfortunately the game is very confusing. I didn't understand how to play. A mini skirted woman keeps popping up and bamboozling you with dialogue. Then there's Sgt Spanner, again keeps popping up and talking to much. I really didn't understand the game play.
Jay Freemam	5	November 10, 2020	Downloading now
Ivo Donev	5	November 10, 2020	Best game ever
depressed times	5	November 10, 2020	I love the art style and gameplay of this game. The characters(officers) really help make the game in my opinion. Their U.I could've used some work (e.x: how you naviagte the menus) but overall its an amazing game.
D Murry	1	November 10, 2020	Don't know what to think, game does not even install so what's to rate...!?
Alex	5	November 10, 2020	just wantedd to say, im waiting for this game for a couple moths
Hissho	2	November 10, 2020	Game could be better.but VIP locks modes- one of them is daily quest. Upgrade or get new units you must draw stupid ass lootboxes.lootboxes not showing any unit list. You need multiple units to make them stronger. Game is not hard like most ppls complaining. But it heavily P2W.1draw 900gold and it's smth like ~4$ per 1draw.total 10draws equal 33$.same goes with commanders.Absurd.to greedy.no chance to be competitive with 🐋.OUT. F LOOTBOXES.
William Johnson	1	November 10, 2020	Why am I, just now, getting a notification about the game's availability, when I see people in the reviews say they have been playing for two months?
king paladian	5	November 10, 2020	Really great gamr
T C	1	November 10, 2020	Won't load
ׂ	5	November 10, 2020	Ive never liked any of the other Lilith games. But, this one is amazing with a mix of strategy, mmo, and grind it is definitely fit for most action lovers!
Z Behrad	5	November 10, 2020	Great
Xaviar Lorek	5	November 10, 2020	Really nice!
Clairece Olifaunt	5	November 10, 2020	Nice game

zombiecraft 246	1	November 10, 2020	So i pre-regesterd on my android but i still cant play so ill bump up my stars if you will let android play for it ill boost up thanks
Salar Ghasedi	5	November 10, 2020	Very good graphics without any bug!
Rayna Regan	1	November 10, 2020	Any game developer that has an intro/tutorial like this is a bad game developer. My only advice to them is scrap the whole game and start over. But before do, sit down and talk about what makes a good game and why you missed every single mark.
Chassie Whatham	5	November 10, 2020	Fun
Mchicken Gaming	5	November 10, 2020	Good game Good Graphics But something is missing you should add an air force troop like spitfire or p51 mustang anything and may u make the bunkers easy
CozmoadoX	1	November 10, 2020	I never installed this and I never will
okay okay.	5	November 10, 2020	It is fun i haven't had any bugs and it's getting better and better everytime i play it.
Call of Duty Gaming	4	November 10, 2020	So when ever I log in to the game it loads and stops and when I click on it I get logged out.
Retinder 16	3	November 10, 2020	needs graphics improvement
joe shosha	1	November 10, 2020	Very very bad game When I downloaded the game it told me that it needs an update so I let it then it didn't want to work and it made the update again
Quintasia Pettie	5	November 10, 2020	Say goodbye to boredom
Stanislava Hosten	5	November 10, 2020	Very historically accurate. Nice effort!
Scott Barty	5	November 10, 2020	Working good again
Jonathan	3	November 10, 2020	Would have liked to play the Raven faction - one playable faction is a bit meager
radman noorbakhsh	5	November 10, 2020	cool game
Katharine Durkin	5	November 10, 2020	I just don’t know if I just played.
Renald Hoggin	5	November 10, 2020	High quality! The visual effect looks special
Felipe Jimenez	5	November 10, 2020	I love to play the game a lot
Tony George Rivers	1	November 11, 2020	Usually when phone is not compatible with a mobile phone it would usually not waste data by down loading onto a device only then to say that it doesn't work on said phone
Star informatic	3	November 11, 2020	Why there is no pre register rewards like any other game ?
Terry Solomon	1	November 11, 2020	Buggy and glitchy...and long load time..i uninsalled it..not a fan of glitchy games
LJ10 LJ10	5	November 11, 2020	Unexpected but welcome came in expecting a crappy p2w game that takes hours for every action but it seems to be the extact opposite with resources only taking a few minutes, not happy with the energy system but it's large enough you can still get alot done
Gamer Online	3	November 11, 2020	Title screen, moonspeak, black screen. . . Closes. Game looks cool tho. . . If I could play it. . .
Darkslide	1	November 11, 2020	My review has already been deleted twice now because you don't want to hear the truth. This game is a copy paste from every other pay to win freemium mobile strategy game since the beginning. With Company of Heroes on mobile now there's no excuse for a company to put out trash like this when there's already a gold standard that your game will be compared to. If you can't hit that mark & put a game out with a one-time upfront fee for all content then just stop trying.
James Newman	1	November 11, 2020	Damn game won't install at all
Khaos SektoR	3	November 11, 2020	Ok so if waited all this time to play this game and I can't because it says I need a 5.0 or greater Android.....but when I looked at what I had....I have a 7.0 or greater Android...so idk what's the problem but now it won't let me play the game....can someone help
Dead Men	3	November 11, 2020	Decent game but the 2 problems I have it always takes you by hand and every soldier sounds like the cloaker from payday 2
Vurge II	1	November 11, 2020	I cant load in so Chinese symbols pop up then take me to a blank screen
killer wolf	5	November 11, 2020	This game is amazing and a must try.
Toi Asprey	5	November 11, 2020	Some of items are AMAZING!!
Tr 4	1	November 11, 2020	Sucks worst game in the world
Andrej Z.	1	November 11, 2020	Another game where big spenders attack and kill you. There are no shields, no peace treaties, so when you work or sleep, your army gets destroyed. Useless game.
Denis Anufriev	5	November 11, 2020	People, how could you rate this project below 4 *? Yes, the game may not be perfect at the moment, but it is still under development and such minor bugs will be fixed very soon. Overall, the game is great. Excellent graphics, all characters are animated, an interesting plot. Beautiful mysterious video inserts. Even buildings, vehicles and weapons change their appearance with every upgrade! And there are interesting real historical facts about all weapons and vehicles presented there. Love it 5*
Carlos Fleites	5	November 11, 2020	So I'm enjoying the game very much!! Love that is a more aggressive type of RTS. There's almost no waiting time to deploy unit, they move faster and you actually see them fighting, so you don't play the waiting game. There's a interesting story. Really pumped to see where the game goes.
Khory Cowl	5	November 11, 2020	Awesome and adictive game
Adelf Hickler Master Of Spoons	5	November 11, 2020	Sucks monkey nut
Brandon Williams	4	November 11, 2020	Wow!

James Saunier	2	November 11, 2020	I pre registered and was so exited for the game it looked amazing just the game i was looking for just to find out in the game not in the app store that my device is not able to support the game i would really like to have known before I uninstalled like 8 games just to play
Matt	2	November 11, 2020	It is constantly crashing and won't run. I will update this if I can get through the intro without the game closing.
Mortalxboy Chan	5	November 11, 2020	This game is amazing it is the most kindness game ever because the DEV always give you gifts and always forgives you for any lag or anything and it is so fun 👍 I recommend you 99.9% to try this game out you will be addicted to it seriously I've been playing this game since it just started my alliance name SAWS and we love WARPATH!
Joneshia Vynall	5	November 11, 2020	Cool historic-related game! so realistic!
Nate M	1	November 11, 2020	Awful spent 20 bucks and it was a waste of time and money. And cant even do what i want deleted game moving on
Čeněk Urbanec	2	November 11, 2020	The art (visuals, audio) is amazing but it does instant gratification crazy often, couldn't get myself to continue
Dariah Biaggioli	5	November 11, 2020	Cool game!
Dale Smith	1	November 11, 2020	Game broken at first hurdle. Very poor support. I had the initial airdrop and it's now stuck in a cycle and wont let me progress. Very bad very sad!!
Kendrick Beyer	4	November 11, 2020	This game is awsome the only complaints I have is that not all the troops can be assembled such as the milita but I hope that this is just because the game just started
Gaël M	1	November 11, 2020	Encore un clash of clan like. Aussitôt testé, aussitôt desinstallé.
C.H R	1	November 11, 2020	So...is it suppose to take long to load? Gams already downloaded. I see what I think is Asian wording and behind that is the screen game(picture).
S.G.T Lutz	5	November 11, 2020	Its a vary great game im having alot of fun
Tony F	3	November 11, 2020	Would have been 5 stars if it was historically accurate what are you scared for? The Nazis were history there's no rational sense in censoring history or we'll be doomed to repeat it.
Paul Felgate	2	November 11, 2020	Good game, but once you get so to level 21 it's impossible to play without spending actual resl hard earned money you could spend on your kid/car
Sam Hicks	4	November 11, 2020	I am actually kinda impressed with this game. Try it I guess
Philly_ Keem	5	November 11, 2020	Love this game as a free to player I don't have so much to say but the people who don't speak English it's really hard to communicate in the game but everything else is lovely and nice! 🥴
Sarmad Mirfendrski	1	November 11, 2020	so bad
Hooman Panahi	2	November 11, 2020	Not Good
connor freetime	1	November 11, 2020	it won't work I am playing on a chromebook touch screen hp and it just keeps kicking me out of it.
midas nightmare	4	November 11, 2020	Awesome game but the world map Two problems has to be villages to build command centers and energy being used to do all actions on map I assume it's implement ed so people don't over farm but it also helps you guys cause it cost gold for more energy anyways as a trying to be f2p player 1day to refill 150 energy is alot . Also it's kinda annoying that players who almade a clan by them self can block u from using a village because we apparently are in there territory?
Joshua Vieira	5	November 11, 2020	Good job
Kevin	1	November 11, 2020	This game is very difficult to understand. I do not recommend this game to anyone.
Ace King	5	November 11, 2020	I like it its uniquely different from other base builders I've played over the years
maybe turtolial	5	November 11, 2020	Haven't played it yet only reason it gets 5stars is because I watched this game on YouTube
ultimate storm trooper	5	November 11, 2020	It been five hours and already people are rating it wow just amazing how dome of the people are a little THICK
Eduardo Tomas	1	November 11, 2020	"Seems like an interesting and fun game, but I am unable to play it now after playing just once. The app will open, bring up the splash screen, then Chinese text will appear that I think translates to ""Click to log in again"". I do so, the screen goes black for a moment, but still fails after retrying, and gives the ""Click to log in again"" text again. I'd like to keep playing and give this game a chance, so please fix this. :)"
Lucas Elly	4	November 11, 2020	So why i give it 4 stars is because you can't move your base to clan members.
Carlos Arroyo	1	November 11, 2020	I hate the fact that it only work with Wi-Fi eventho I have good internet connection
Dean Fraley Jr	1	November 11, 2020	It sucks
Edgaras Gr	1	November 11, 2020	Gives error message ( this device is unsupported by the game ) even on new tablet
teh Mandolorian2829	5	November 11, 2020	I love this game its just like how it got promoted but not being able to occupy citiys without and alliance or destroying an alliance base seems dumb to me but this game is fun
Bobby Beach	2	November 11, 2020	When I call in the air drop in the beginning but when the plane comes on screen it just says the same thing before that
ĐỨc Lê Hồng	4	November 11, 2020	It is a very decent game, although it can be too fast-paced in developments and become time-consuming. Will replay when I have more time. Wonder if you could introduce Air Force (not only scouts but fighters and bombers) and Navy?
Amirabbas Gharayagh	5	November 11, 2020	It's BRILLIANT 👍
Rachel Ditto	3	November 11, 2020	Unable it get past the load screen. Stuck at 0.00 percent. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Same issue.
Rain Ibas	5	November 11, 2020	cant play
Daniel Ng	1	November 11, 2020	Misleading ads
Toasty Fine	3	November 11, 2020	"I've played this game for about a few hours now, and it's just too complicated. I can't even do what I want to do, it's always directed at me and forced. AND I CANT EVEN MAKE MY OWN NAME!!!!! Like seriously, why can I have certain words like ""Commissar"" or ""Warden"" in my name? It keeps telling me ""Illegal characters used"" and it's so annoying. Please make it so we can have custom names with different words."
Random Name	5	November 11, 2020	This game is epic if you make it through the 30 minute tutorial and into the real game with open world persistent map you can see every players movements in realtime
Jeff Winters	5	November 11, 2020	Well so far looks like it could be a fun game. Now some issues with setup. Transport. Location identify. I'm been playing for a day and still moving to new location lol.
Tha Pig	1	November 11, 2020	"This game just appeared on my phone today. I didn't install it or requested. The notification says I ""pre-registered"" for it, which is NOT TRUE. I don't play games on my phone at all. I think it's some kind of malware."
David	5	November 11, 2020	A really good game i love the everything in the game and and the graphica could be better like your other games but it's still good by the way I love the game rise of kingdoms keep doing more games
Donavong Steelej	5	November 11, 2020	I love learning about world war II so I think I'm going to love this game
Anthony Brown	5	November 11, 2020	I love this game this my favorite game keep it up
Hayden	5	November 11, 2020	Very similar to Rise of Kingdoms but unique enough in mechanics to be a new experience. Seems to combine elements from AFK arena and RoK. Overall enjoying the game so far.
Dylan Wayne	5	November 11, 2020	Love it, but I like a more sandbox type war game but then again it is an awesome game.
Gil McComb	1	November 11, 2020	Boring. Looks nothing like the adverts. Also, no British.
KingOfGlory	2	November 11, 2020	It's a fun game but it feels copy & pasted multiple times by multiple different companies so nothing to say there and the games performance isn't overall that great and the tutorial is good though just not my style I guess
Ismail Saric	1	November 11, 2020	Why did not load in?
Gan Jia Pao	3	November 11, 2020	A game with full of bugs (chat keep failed, alliance point recovery not accurate, picture failed to send), but the customer response is quick, and the problem solving is not much effective, so i will rate it as 3 star
Ben Martin	2	November 11, 2020	Unable to play on chromebook even though it can play many ios games with ease. Needs to be optimized for chromebook as well as more ios devices.
cool dude Hess	5	November 11, 2020	Cool
Happathecat Meme	1	November 11, 2020	LET ME DOWNLOAD THE GAME
My Laila Lopez	5	November 11, 2020	Love it
Ryan Fitzsimmons	1	November 11, 2020	I can't even get in, it immediately goes to a translucent grey screen with some writing in Chinese. Is this happening to anyone else? How do I fix it?
Luke 18:13	5	November 11, 2020	I don't know what these bad reviews are talking about, this games is not difficult to play. Although it's simple to understand, gameplay kinda gets boring. But other than that, it's simple to figure out and a good time waster.
coa902	4	November 11, 2020	It's a good game. But if you want players let them play the game. The tutorial is way too long and the characters talk too much
tony chaps	1	November 11, 2020	Real good now you have to download daily .....sarcasm
Shawn	1	November 11, 2020	Can't even get the game to start up.
Crash_	5	November 11, 2020	This game is amazing! I have been waiting since i saw BaronVonGames play it. The only complaint i have is that i would like to see a feature where you can group you troops into group A, B, and C.
CT_7567 PMC	1	November 11, 2020	Wow gane i rwally wanna try byt it aint allowed for my device or aint playable i should say
Paul Lewis	4	November 11, 2020	It's not bad. I just don't like the guild thing any more. It's for kids, it's too limiting and it is kinda worn out for me. Besides, I think this game would be much better as a solo game. But, since you don't allow that, I can't continue. So, thanks for letting me try it!
HunterM Valentine	5	November 11, 2020	The game is great, just one suggestion have more barracks than just 5.
TXC_hillbilly136 _	5	November 11, 2020	Game is the best, don't let haters bring you down
Eyasin Hosain	1	November 11, 2020	Its Dubliketed by clas of clans,its very bad game is the world game
midnightspooky e	5	November 11, 2020	You had me at jontron
Yelo V	5	November 11, 2020	I like the game a lot. Im a fan of Wll games. But there is one problem. The controls on this game is understandable but sometimes it just gets confusing I understand the controls and sometimes not. Another thing is launguage. I understand there is a translator but some people don't use it or even know what's it for.But anyways the game is great. Graphics are good and so is the gameplay and all I see is women as officers like I know they have rights too but it's kinda weird.Either way good game.
Joan Cifer	1	November 11, 2020	Not good lol so complicated and same story at the beginning as rise of kingdoms but different voices I dont know how to even upgrade my commander it's too tough
Rufet Eminov	1	November 11, 2020	"Still p2w. Epic lilith games. This game is ""rise of kingdom""s copy, past game. 😠"
CHEEZY GAMING	5	November 11, 2020	It's a fun game its feels like clash of clan wit halo wars feel but how do switch ur country I'm stuck deep Europe or outskirts Asia n only get players from that region I'm trying to play in the USA where I can communicate wit ppl
William Guest	1	November 11, 2020	"Opening scene ""General Eisenhower "" wearing Patton style six shooters on his side. Oh you have ""model"" as your adjutant. Right. Typical "" Pay2Play"" app. Get recuits and send them out on a bare field to meet the enemy. Totally idiotic so called strategy game. Deleted."
Omartin Mays	5	November 11, 2020	Best game ever but the campain is so boring but either then that its such a gkkd game keep it up developers
Mohammad Mansoor	1	November 11, 2020	download cant play game black screens amd have newest android game is trash
Michael Ashley	5	November 11, 2020	Amazing 100stars
WILD TACO	5	November 11, 2020	I love the way how you can battle.
Javiar Gonzalez	1	November 11, 2020	Won't load up after it shows me the version info
Gabby Wilson	1	November 11, 2020	I wish I could go to another server without LOSING MY ENTIRE PROGRESS!!!
mikelr6	1	November 11, 2020	Can't play because it's not supported on device
engel des unglücks	4	November 11, 2020	really fun game definitely a must try, an as for the ppl saying its confusing, its really not theres a tutorial showing you everything, my only concern is the time it takes for energy to recharge an our reserve soldiers it takes what seems like forever to get as foe everything else i enjoy it alot keep up the good work 👍
Ely Brettaigne	2	November 11, 2020	Rinse and repeat. If you haven't played this (SO many games like it) before, you must be a 12-year-old with your first mobile phone. Nothing new here. Pay to win for sure. Absolute repetitive gameplay. No brain required.
Dre Board	1	November 11, 2020	Not fun
Nitehart	1	November 11, 2020	No faction change
CabooseBlue	2	November 11, 2020	Would love to give a better rating, but I installed the game only for it to say it's not supported on my device. :/
Asmitha Eagling	5	November 11, 2020	Super realistic! Some of the classic historical events are represented in this game!
Zumar Hanif	1	November 11, 2020	Doesn't worth your time it's fun in the beginning but you will believe me once you hit level 10. This is a pure garbage game from a greedy ass money grab developers.
Mumtaz Ahmad Mostaqvim	4	November 11, 2020	Intresting and easy to play
Yukina Slyford	5	November 11, 2020	The game is easy to get started.
Enrique Sablan	5	November 11, 2020	A nice change of gameplay compared to other boring pay to win slg games.Its truly real time gameplay on a multiplayer map,where you have the ability to command your units
htun linn kyaw	4	November 11, 2020	I just start played this morning for this games. Not so bad, it's more like RTS game play.
Skizr 420	1	November 11, 2020	It was great then stopped working today. Just crashes at startup. Message on screen in a language I can't identify accurately. Then just gets stuck in a loop of reset and crash. Those 3 hours i got to play yesterday were great, but after two reinstall attempts, seems like the game is now broken.
Quanya Higgonet	5	November 11, 2020	I would reccommend this game to my friends.
Johnathan Collett	2	November 11, 2020	Couldn't even get into the game. All I saw was what I believe was Mandarin ( think that's how to spell the name to the language) then a black screen and it was like I just used my data for a black screen app. Witch in my opinion is 100% useless. But hey that might just be me.
E A	3	November 11, 2020	The game isn't really that fun. For me it's boring and no I would not play it in the future.
Stoyan Kasabov	5	November 11, 2020	Very nice game, I like the graphics and how easy to play is.
Jeren Edwicke	5	November 11, 2020	Such a nice game!
Sean King	5	November 11, 2020	It looks and feels amazing
Peyton Stowers	1	November 11, 2020	Same lame junk app not like add
Archangel Loki	1	November 11, 2020	The game looked and felt great while playing on WiFi, however once switching to mobile data the game completely fails to load. A mobile game that doesn't work while mobile is quite dissapointing. I sincerely hope it gets fixed as this game shows alot of promise as a mobile strategy game.
PA Gomez	1	November 11, 2020	I would give the game 0 Stars but I can't ever since the new update I can't install the game I wish them developers will get on this because I would really like to try out their game
American stalker	1	November 11, 2020	I am not allowed to play this game they said that my device cannot support this game, game designers please tell me what does this mean I'm new to the smartphone
Soban Red	4	November 11, 2020	The game is very good and definitely held up to my expectations. The graphics are pretty good, story is interesting, and game play is very good. As unlike other RTS games like this you can actually move units around and not have to go back to base after every battle. But if I had any gripes about the game, it would be the glitch if you spend gold to speed up your research to buy speed ups. It takes all your gold jo mater how much your have nor how much the speed up costed.
Tymisha Waltho	5	November 11, 2020	Great game!
Mohamed Maged Mohamed El Ahmedy Soliman	5	November 11, 2020	It is a wonderful game
Abang Tamvan	3	November 11, 2020	Love it! But, force close everytime I zoom out to the city
shahpour ghoreishe	5	November 11, 2020	One of the best mobile game. Please workomg more on performance and geraphic
harry fitra	1	November 11, 2020	cant start the game it said not compatible, so why I can download it waste my data for nothing :v
Fanthegamer	5	November 11, 2020	Great game best game I played but the only problem is that you start in a random place my friend started far away from me and I cant get to him maybe choose a thing where when you join you can choose your location then you can start playing.
Ashton Neel	4	November 11, 2020	Game is great and all but it doesn't load in for my regular data but it would load in for wifi fix this please.
Jomar Bautista	1	November 11, 2020	Mission 1-8 is too impossible i get defeated due to reinforcements coming its just too impossible
Tobye Clemits	5	November 11, 2020	Very fun game, cool weapons and tanks.
Sutol Dornekce	1	November 11, 2020	I can't even play it- I supposeily have not the right device, an LG to be exact.
Kingstun Bushe	5	November 11, 2020	Very interesting, I cant stop playing.
E.D Theme Park & Attractions	3	November 11, 2020	There are a lot of things I enjoy. However it has its downsides.
lieutenant wolf	1	November 11, 2020	Yea i give up its not letting me on at all and it keeps saying does not work on this device and i unstalled and reinstalled 6 times now so i give up
Mason Coe	2	November 11, 2020	Was looking forward to playing but i just get a foreign message across my screen then it crashes, tried deleting and re downloading 3 times and it didnt help.
Dylan Colander	4	November 11, 2020	It is a very good game that has potential for being a popular pick for a strategy game. I have a few problems though. First, the officers seem a little powerful. Second, sometimes the buttons dont work even though the game isnt frozen. Third, the alliance system needs to be better in every way. And fourth, there needs to be more objectives to complete WITHOUT alliance members. Overall, this is a good game that needs improving. But you should give it a chance.
Jaxon Kaiser	1	November 11, 2020	Its exactly like Rise of Kingdoms...
Carter Benzon	4	November 11, 2020	Anyone else get this game from the jontron ad?
Gesina Boxen	5	November 11, 2020	Nice game to kill time!
J Haver	5	November 11, 2020	Just what I'm looking for
Mike Pino	5	November 11, 2020	I love it
Brian Garza	4	November 11, 2020	Some little bugs here and there but its a new game. Soooo much potential
Bobby Kutz	5	November 11, 2020	I love this game!!!
Ttv.Killimanjaro117	5	November 11, 2020	It's a fun time sink type game.
David Caldwell	4	November 11, 2020	Staying busy love that it's a strategy game that is a little more challenging.
Andy Anderson	4	November 11, 2020	Pretty good game, major downside is it falls off into a waiting for resources game too quickly. The recharge time for energy is a travesty. Over all though it has good mechanics and storyline.
Tony Tan	4	November 11, 2020	Fun and exciting
Jack Meoff	3	November 11, 2020	The game is great. The energy feature is why u won't get 5 stars from me it regenerates to slowly and costs gold to refill without waiting
Dakota Hartline	4	November 11, 2020	I really like and have been telling my friend all about it. Thanks for making a good game
mäus-chan	5	November 11, 2020	I love this game, 10/10, I've seen builder games before but this is by far the best and most addictive one I've played especially with eh ww2 accuracy!
Blake Robbins	5	November 11, 2020	It has been a very good experience. Takes elements from different genres and throws a good campaign. I like being able to control units. I definitely do not regret pre registering and playing. It is worth downloading and playing
Dennis Guss	4	November 12, 2020	Great graphics, only gave it 4 stars,because as with everything,there's always room for improvement
Karen Kazarian	4	November 12, 2020	I don't know why some people flame this game being complicated. Been playing the game 24h now and I want to keep playing it. Yes, this game complex comparing to similar war (base building) games but what I like most about it is the blend of campaign missions (including voice overs and not text reading) with unit controls and global map with things to do. There were some issues regarding controls of units like double tap actions and I would really appreaciate skip cutscene button.
dwane Winston	5	November 12, 2020	Love it, the detail and setup are perfect.
Matt P	4	November 12, 2020	Awesome game
Alexis Mejia	5	November 12, 2020	Good game💯👍
Rob Derr	1	November 12, 2020	Can't play on mobile data, works on wifi only
fire king	5	November 12, 2020	I like how the story of this game is that allies are working with Russians against the ravens.
Miquan Bailes	5	November 12, 2020	So addictive lol
Edward Varner	5	November 12, 2020	Great time Killer
Physco- commando3	5	November 12, 2020	Best wwll game out there just great.
erikdylan316erik	5	November 12, 2020	This game is really good, plus playing with friends and with you allies is very competitive and a good challenge.
Emad Raoofie	4	November 12, 2020	بازی خیلی خوبه ولی چرا وقتی نقشه رو بزرگ میکنم سه تا گزینه داره گزینه سوم رو میزنم میندازه بیرون الان هم رو گزینه سوم هست اصلا نمیتونم نقشه رو بزرگ کنم یک آبدیت بدین
021 021	5	November 12, 2020	Top
David Shumaker	4	November 12, 2020	Great WW2 theme, graphics, sounds, upgrades, units leaders. Big drawback is energy consuption to play is harsh. You cqn play a little then have to spend real money every day to keep playing if you have time to play, or play till energy runs out n quit till next time ( most people will grow tired of that and move to another game).
Google Services	4	November 12, 2020	Great experience.
Саша Поляков	5	November 12, 2020	Nice
Randall Wolffe	5	November 12, 2020	It is good
Phil Heasley	5	November 12, 2020	I love this game...it is addictive...and to top it off it a good WWII rpg type game!
Pepé N	2	November 12, 2020	The game is fun to play, only bad part is it won't load unless I'm on wifi.
To tot288	5	November 12, 2020	I made a mistake it is online
Chaia Johnstone	5	November 12, 2020	Impeccable game, recommended to all players.
Kyle Leach	1	November 12, 2020	This game won't even download And I had to give a star in order to say something
Sir Hanif	2	November 12, 2020	why after i update the games always crashers went i start the games
Jasiri Tirrey	5	November 12, 2020	The game is fun to play, very good
A guy	5	November 12, 2020	Nice game, theres alot of stuff going on but heres my suggestion if the game update again 1.more land for bacrack and stuff 2. Add more weapon tank or even armored car british japanese tanks 3. More chapter and quest 4. And more commaders like other countries france more german commander british american japanese italian etc
HITORMISS IGUESSTHEYNEVERMISSHUH	4	November 12, 2020	The voice acting and graphics are good, Overall a really fun game
Mohanad.N zubair	3	November 12, 2020	The game is so good and I can see the new features in these type of games pretty obvious but the problem is I can't check how can be a pro map in other words I cant check toppers.....
samuel karlen	5	November 12, 2020	super
Kenneth Bartlett	1	November 12, 2020	Promotes white supremacy
Mark Baredon Roca	5	November 12, 2020	Good game
Brandon Bosley	1	November 12, 2020	It strated saying my phone isnt compatibe
Mister Toasty	5	November 12, 2020	i think this game is really great! the only problem i have is with the energy limit! i dont think its a bad idea, but i think it should be for campaign missions, instead of materials gathering, or at least imcrease the rate at which it recharges. it really sucks when i dont have enough energy to play!
Jim Dupont	5	November 12, 2020	Expect timers, but besides that expect a polished experience and smooth gameplay. Graphics are solid, and yes it has VIP, but it's not in ya face. Definitely worth a try!
J King	5	November 12, 2020	Great just Great
Garma Biwock	3	November 12, 2020	After 2 days of playing I've run out of things to do good game ,but lacks events
Logan Rose	2	November 12, 2020	I keep running into the issue where it won't load past main menu when on cellular data but has no problem on WIFI. I have great service when I do try it outside of the wifi so I'm not sure what the deal is. Also pops up in a language I'm unfamiliar with, but I assume it says log in error or something.
Michael Wilkinson	5	November 12, 2020	I've been waiting for this game to come out, it's fun and time consuming I was always a big ww2 fan great game
Tuan Duong	5	November 12, 2020	Really nice game
Anthony Jimenez	5	November 12, 2020	Interesting just getting use to playing...
james howarth	3	November 12, 2020	Game won't load I'm a level 9. My user name is Youngdolph. I don't want to lose my account and start over. Response to GM. I have deleted it reinstall and done everything you can think of. The game only works in WIFI. When i am on my service provider network the game doesn't load. I have 5G connection and Samsung galaxy S20+
ခ်မ္းလင္း ေန	1	November 12, 2020	I was waiting for this game but when I open it the game crashes and shows a text and keeps opening the game.
JE .M	1	November 12, 2020	Just downloaded the game because the ads is annoying Please stop create a original game
Tarek Sammour	5	November 12, 2020	The game i great but there's a bug sometimes i have 3 tanks and sometimes i have 1 eaven if i trained troops plzz fix
Darren Van Wyk	1	November 12, 2020	It's a great game if you can actually log into it. Apparently because I live in Canada the game won't work on data for me. Only wifi.... and they are blaming me for this problem
Ben Tucker	5	November 12, 2020	Fun way to learn about history
Isaac Davies	5	November 12, 2020	I think
Ben Desbien	4	November 12, 2020	I'm enjoying the game right but my biggest complaint at the moment is that I can't play without wifi.
Preston Ceci	1	November 12, 2020	It doesn't even let me play when I got a different device it's still don't let me play so I'm giving it a one star
zachary sloan	1	November 12, 2020	Crash after in app update, it will act like it loads. Then it goes to a black screen and it won't let me connect to the game servers and shows up with some Chinese writing.
Aaron Janson	1	November 12, 2020	um no? the ads are nowhere near what the game turned out to be as usual. turns out, yep it's just another empire clone... jesus christ what is wrong with you!? stop cloning and get to WORK or quit choose one!
Abed taha	5	November 12, 2020	The best 2020 strategy game ❤
Josh LaCanne	4	November 12, 2020	Crashes sometimes when I go into a campaign but it would be neat if you could add some sort of naval combat to the game.
Vic Coll	5	November 12, 2020	So far...so good... Haha no for real, this game is the best strategy game ive ever played. Ngl!
muhammad adeel khalil	1	November 12, 2020	Hi its not running on my mobile due to non support
IronBoundDust7	2	November 12, 2020	I'm having fun playing the game but it keeps crashing
Noah Hopkins	5	November 12, 2020	It can get a little laggy at times, but it's still good. I love how it has a campaign, the one thing I don't like is how long it takes to move your base, if there could be one thing I would want fixed it would be that
Jake P	1	November 12, 2020	Won't play!! Has to update. I wait 30 mins for a 433 MB download just for it to say download failed. Tried multiple times.
Danielle Hubler	1	November 12, 2020	I'm only going to put a 1 star because it keeps on crashing without me even playing the game but if you fix it I will change my review so plz fix this bug
Juan Fajardo	5	November 12, 2020	Awesome, but i wanna dump some cash on it and i dont see anything worth. :/
tech gamer	5	November 12, 2020	👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Maurice Marriott	4	November 12, 2020	Very easy to play with a great story line
Alyna Chadwick	3	November 12, 2020	Overall nice change of pace from similar games. DEVELOPERS: PLEASE fix the bugs! Resources are disappearing, time is reset on villages/research. I know this game is fairly new so please fix this bug. Other than that, it's an awesome game.
Daniel Estrada	1	November 12, 2020	Hello! I just downloaded the game today. I was and still am looking forward to playing this game. The issue I'm encountering is that it seems to be buggy. I'm just starting off and when it tells me to do something in the tutorial it doesn't crash but it doesn't let me do anything else. I close and re open the app, everything goes well right until I have to do the task. Please solve this or tell me how I can solve this.
Mr DoTa	5	November 12, 2020	Very good game
Aaron Muir	2	November 12, 2020	Multiplayer is confusing and very slow, the single player campaign was great to start with, having a an actual scenario and testing how you play, but just becomes a boring grind
Stacy Hickey	5	November 12, 2020	"I love this game so far!!! Super smooth graphics and auper addicting! I have one small problem right now though.. Im trying to research,and it keeps saying something like ""que #2 locked"" yet i am not currently researching anything. So whats the problem??"
morteza saedian	5	November 12, 2020	this game is awsome good graphic good graphic
Alex Hernanedz	5	November 12, 2020	COOL GAME 🎮
Juan jr Pacheco	1	November 12, 2020	Can't log in going to install
Jj Jones	1	November 12, 2020	Game will not load. It will load using wifi but not regular cellular data.
Angel Arvisu	4	November 12, 2020	It is a great game easy concepts
David Chen	2	November 12, 2020	The guns that the infantry look too modern to be wwii related. They look mostly like m4s. I will raise this up to 5 stars if you guys can remodel the infantry's weapons. And it would be awesome if you added in battle ships. And like add a giant ocean in the middle of the map. And give everyone another separate base to operate on the oceans. Or you could add in units that can build temporary bridges that will collapse in say 10 or 20 minutes depending on the units level.
AYUBA SYLVER	5	November 12, 2020	A good strategy game
Hector Gonzalez	5	November 12, 2020	This is a AWESOME game not gunna lie
faruq Ibrahim	5	November 12, 2020	Cool
Spooskey	5	November 12, 2020	Great concept. Having a hard time running for longer than 20 mins or so at a time. I'm assuming overheating from an older z2 is where I'm lacking. Great game overall so far.
bill maines	5	November 12, 2020	My experience is really good I love how can actually see the troops fight and my alliances already had a miny war and we are the strongest one in our server
Knight of the brave	4	November 12, 2020	I've noticed that your resources like cement and brick that they disappear but eventually come back but it's annoying, but other than that the game is really good it's not like army men of war if you ever played that.
Damian Murray	4	November 12, 2020	Really good game. It's still really new, so there are plenty of details and small things that can be improved. For one, it would be nice to be able to view other's bases from their profile. This game uses energy to collect resources that you can use to improve your base. Upgrading takes no time, which is very nice, but the energy recharges slowly. 30hrs to fully replenish you 150 pool, which can get you 15 resources from enemies found on the map. Other small things I can't put, but good game.
CHRIS Hawkins	4	November 12, 2020	The concept is brilliant and could work amazingly, I found the graphics impressive for a mobile game and I loved the attention to detail from some of the historical character types. However I really struggled to enjoy playing it as to me the narrative at times felt forced, and some of the voice acting didn't feel natural. However if it wasn't for the unfortunately unimpresive voice acting, and some of the filler missions, the game would be a solid 5 stars.
Ibrahim Ahmed	4	November 12, 2020	Good
Sulima Adorować Sarai	1	November 12, 2020	Can't download the game lol
Luis Larracuente	1	November 12, 2020	Will not download. Reset cache reset data, reset network settings, restarted phone still Will not load.

Daniel Sheppard	5	November 12, 2020	I love war games for the cellphone and it has great graphics great gameplay great storylines
gacha kid 3 xbox	5	November 12, 2020	I really like it the story is going so well. And i really want to know the end yay
Phillip Burks	4	November 12, 2020	Its really great but its still kinda iffy
Joshua Johnson	4	November 12, 2020	The game is good so far and the graphics are great but the energy takes way to long get back and resources take forever to get. Despite that though so far everything has been attainable without spending money. Can we get a faster way to get energy and different resources?
Mr. Satler	2	November 12, 2020	But the same as all the rest of them of course with your own twist
Jeffrey Baughman	5	November 12, 2020	Good so far, time will tell all
Jig Aboo	1	November 12, 2020	Way too many bugs Alliance inv doesnt work uninstall now😡

nunung fatimah	5	November 12, 2020	Its soooo cool i made a cool army thx warpath
Jake Roye	5	November 12, 2020	Wow... This game is truly amazing! I watched many ads about this game and I thought it was boring and fake, but when I tried it out, it was really fun and enjoying! The missions are easy tho, this doesn't need to be a P2W, this is more of F2P games! I really love this game! I hoped that you would add more storyline, the storyline was epic.
saba kazmi	5	November 12, 2020	Nice
Zechariah Moriarty	1	November 12, 2020	Trash i try to play this game a it sayed does not sopprt this device like what

David Carrion	1	November 12, 2020	Not enuff fighting in thw game
U Kiss	4	November 12, 2020	Everything is good. The only thing I don't like is vertical gameplay.
Jacob Scherer	5	November 12, 2020	The gold bars dont disappear when I spend them then when I load the game back it then shows it spent I think theres a bug in the game u guys should fix that and in exchange for this info I would like a good amount of gold and gold universal coupons please and thank u

Austin Johnson	4	November 12, 2020	Not a fan of rise of kingdom but this 1 just feels completely different. I love how you can see the action and in all is not a bad game. The only thing that stopped it from getting a all 5 stars was the fact I didn't get to pick my server from the begin. I got put in a server in Moscow Russia while I live In the US. The ingame translate doesn't get all the words, but I am able to get the jist of what they are saying. You can make a second account and pick our server but have to start over again
Austin Thomas	1	November 12, 2020	Nothing new here same old pay to win war game. Really you need to make it so if you leave an alliance you can't join one for 48 or 72 hours or something. People jump from alliance to alliance just to get location information then they go back to there original alliance and divulge said locations.
Jorel B. Acosta	5	November 12, 2020	The game is great all I can ask for is to increase the graphics for the units make them look more realistic they look very cartoony. Make them look more real like.
Aaron Gabriel L. Novesteras	4	November 12, 2020	An interesting and unique RTS military game that I can play for hours on end. I would love to see more buildings, more units, and more features to expound the emphasis on its theme. I would love to see naval warfare, dog fights, and so on. The only problem I want to point out is the controls. The way I try to give maneuvers to my troops is kind of frustrating since they are sensitive when I select them. It'd be best if there was a way to minimize that. Anyways, it's a good executed game! Kudos!
Urazn 1	1	November 12, 2020	Game crashes right after downloading.
Trex_ 101	2	November 12, 2020	Historical accuracy just can't exist anymore I guess
DK Games	5	November 12, 2020	Very very good games.

Gaming Grady.	1	November 12, 2020	Can you please make this avalible on the Galaxy Tab A plz that would make my day,. When I start the game it shows not available on this device plz fix i love these types of games.
MaJdY 963	1	November 12, 2020	when i registered for this game i was hyped, then I released that its another copy of CROSSFIRE and RISE OF KINGDOMS.
David Mcdonald	5	November 12, 2020	So far really cool
Lentini Chan	1	November 12, 2020	no fun pay to win . pity....
Furkan Gözükara	1	November 12, 2020	Energy system sucks so bad. Improve it for free players
Roy Vas	5	November 12, 2020	Very Nice Game
Rambo cammando	5	November 12, 2020	I love the grafics the way the system works its so fun i especielly like the clasic field gun the guys got an atitude though and i love that atitude have fun if you see this and get the game.
Mahmoud Phillips	5	November 12, 2020	It's an awesome game, and tactics is very good manage the troops is also good to play, the only things it needs occupation to make the base bigger like occupying other lands to make bigger base it will be cool,it's not a must ofcourse but it will be great to have it good job for the game
Csaba Pálfy	5	November 12, 2020	Love it :)
Sasha Rainn	5	November 12, 2020	This is the first written review I have given. I love it!! And I'm playing this game more than my others!! And to see that you gain the resources is a lot better than many of the other games out there. Please do what you can for the airborne part, I'm an army airborne ranger veteran, so that will be the coolest!! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
J BERGER	5	November 13, 2020	I love this game flat out it's amazing. Here is a couple things in the game that need to be fixed and or changed please. #1 the disassembly of tanks and artillery please make it so u can do everything not just 3 star and below I want to get rid of a few vehicles that are 4 and 5 star but the game doesnt allow u to disassemble them into scrap and parts like u can with 3 star and below and it sucks lol..#2 unfriending someone u can add friends but u cant get rid of them and it doesn't make sense
Sven Tempest	1	November 13, 2020	"Supports known Racist JonTron ""Wealthy blacks also commit more crime than poor whites, that's a fact. Yeah, look it up."" This quote among countless others that support Alt-Right propaganda come from JonTron in 2016. Playtonic Games had the spine to distance themselves. Warpath developers decide to support him even having him in their adverts. Even if this wasn't a cash grab microtransactions filled grind, it should not be supported because its personnel support racists. Black Lives Matter."
TACO MAN	4	November 13, 2020	Im giving it a 4 out of ten because it was great playing it before I wasnt even able to play it. the graphics were great, but its unplayable now.
Lion Tribe	3	November 13, 2020	This game has alot of potential, but I still think it needs work if it is going to stand a chance to compete with other games such as Kiss Of War. For instance it takes over a whole day for your energy to fully replenish,(I believe it is 1 day and 5 hours) that's a little ridiculous. But the character designs, the graphics, the weapons, the story are all on point. You guys just need to shorten the time it takes to replenish energy.
Jedi Kasep	3	November 13, 2020	Soldier and army cant defeat fast at level 1.. Hmmm.. Too much
Enise Cheevers	5	November 13, 2020	The game is so fun, the music is so good, great!!
Typical Plant	1	November 13, 2020	What the hell this game doesn't support my device but I can install it Like Why?
Max Chan	2	November 13, 2020	I see the ad and wanna give it a try, but can't even install it. It downloaded and keep showing installing, that sometime later the install button reappear again. I am using Zenfone 6 so I guess it's capable to run this game🤷🏻‍♂️
IcowboyIgamer #1	5	November 13, 2020	I love this game i have early access and it is a really great game and it is challenging but that is what makes it so much fun
will smith	5	November 13, 2020	Everything about this game I love, it has real time strategy in a way that makes teamwork more fun with your alliance. You do give the player too much free gold. I think I make like 5000 a day and I havent spent a dime. In 3 days I'm now lvl 17 about to unlock my 5th barracks. Last problem I have is the crafting situation, I can dis-assemble parts but can't craft nothing. This game has serious-serious potential if you guys start spitting out updates. See ya in the battleground.
Melanie Sakai	5	November 13, 2020	Awesome
Caira Collins	1	November 13, 2020	I played this for over 6 weeks put some money in got to 2.5m power then the monthly sup costs alot more after the first buy its a good f2p but ur not going to get anywhere if u dont p2p cos the rss u need to upgrade is ridiculous if u dont spend money to keep up with paying players
Nigel Guerrero	4	November 13, 2020	"The game is great. But similar to other ""Real Time Strategy"" games on mobile which makes it seem more like a clone than an actually solid game. The campaign is great but the difficulty rises to fast, outpacing the player, forcing them to either grind extensively or pay. Grinding by all means isn't bad but when the grind wall is so high then obviously it will annoy people. Last thing is the energy recovery should be faster or energy completely removed. I hit the limit but I do have more."
Ilesa Rommel	1	November 13, 2020	Just went to the splash screen and has Chinese text then went to a black screen and stops working after that.
Makhaya Blackett	5	November 13, 2020	My experience with this game is the most coolest and best WWII strategy ever, even the Intro to the game is the best, it helps you to understand how to play the game and it makes you get the hang of the game and good at it if you pay attention, I really do not know how you other guys are rating this even below 5* but you guys have to understand, this game is still in development according to the other player and to be honest even those this is in development, developers please do a cold war game
Kaleb Berdiner	1	November 13, 2020	The game won't evan open for me it just show either Japanese/Chinese letters
Samuel Morton	1	November 13, 2020	The game is forcing me to build a barracks in the intro but it says I have to be a lvl 2, so I'm just stuck, can't click on anything, can't proceed, just stuck
Alpha Fortress	5	November 13, 2020	Fun, simple, and extremely interesting
rikardo kendella	5	November 13, 2020	The game is very very very good, but I have a problem with my smartphone. The screen is very small for this big game. Thanks
Boom Boi	3	November 13, 2020	It is your typical grow your Kingdom game but it has amazing graphics it is promising that it will be more different in the future but for now I give it a 3 star
Crazygamer Gaming	1	November 13, 2020	Spent 500 gold twice now to start an alliance search alliance can't find it other people search my alliance can't find it I want 1000 gold refunded to my account oh and your link to messenger yields not results I would give zero stars for the game butt it wont let me. Fix the issues add an invite to alliance tab and i will update my rating of the game
Joshua Scroggins	5	November 13, 2020	These games usually don't hold my attention, but I'm a huge fan of world war II so I decided to give it a shot. So far I love it I'm going to be on this game for a long time I can already tell keep up the great work I love the little animations of my soldiers really amazing trying to get my friends to join me.
Eric Tabor	4	November 13, 2020	Great battle game. Easy to understand and play
Ariel Santibanez	1	November 13, 2020	COULD NOT EVEN GET IN.
Calvin Havemann	1	November 13, 2020	idk how game developers make a game that forces you to click arrows and think its fun. you have no control over troops or what buildings you build or where you put them. this is Arrow Clicker the game!
Manthan Chugh	5	November 13, 2020	Fun no adds. though energy takes a bit too long generate. Should half the time too generate. No upgrade timers. And mines provide enough resources. Alliajces are also good. They Should have a cloud save feature through Google play games they update weekly usually so this feature might be added soon😁 I hope it is added soon. But otherwise great.
Julian Greenhalgh	4	November 13, 2020	Yes it is pay to win but if you lose unlike other games when you are attacked you don't lose everything and the troops can be replaced without the need for speeds. The only reason its 4 stars is the pay to win pay wall hits after lvl 18 but you can grind without paying.
Larry Hammons	5	November 13, 2020	Very interesting game actually uses real weapons and not made up names for the different weapon systems
Cactus Hatt	4	November 13, 2020	This is the best game I've played in a long time I know this game just came out but there are a lot of recycled voice lines its getting tiresome hearing them over and over but other then that this game is Really good I cant wait for this game to fully come out
Life is GOOD	2	November 13, 2020	"Originally this was a good game until game was sold to another group. Now game is no fun to play. Buggy & not worth playing now. Hard to figure play out. Feels like your floating through the game without understand 'Play.' UPDATE: Enough people have told Developer all the area's that are 'buggy' etc. Why did your company mess the game up? It really was FANTASTIC in the ""beginning,"" 😒 That is before you all started messing with the game. Just not worth my time anymore. I've Uninstalled game."
Ahmed Zeid	5	November 13, 2020	The game is great in terms of control, but there are many malfunctions and insects in the game, such as the disappearance of some objects in the map suddenly and back and the graphics in the game must be improved and it is desirable to add translation of the conversation in Arabic because it affects negatively
Michael Shafer	1	November 13, 2020	"When I open the game, a screen appears and says ""Game not supported on this device. Try another device"". Why was I even able to download it then?????"
Jonathan Bunner	1	November 13, 2020	Id love to play it but my device is not supported
Jamie	5	November 13, 2020	This is a compelling game with good graphics and some interesting mechanics. I think its a genuine effort by the developer to make a less p2w game that is still fun to play and social. There is obviously still some development work ongoing but I'm excited to see what features are added in future updates. I think its a little unfair to post 1 star reviews if you're having trouble accessing the game.
the modster	5	November 13, 2020	It's a great game but the graphics on the main game are mediocre BUT BESIDES DON'T MAKE IT PAID TO WIN AND KEEP THE RPG STYLE AND YOU GOT A GOOD GAME FIVE OUT OF FIIVE OUT OF FIVE STARS I SHOULD RECOMMEND TO MU FRIEND
Robert Fletcher	5	November 13, 2020	Great 👍
The Lyzzyrd King	1	November 13, 2020	"I really hate to be ""that guy"".... But for real, why do u guys do this? Best thing about ww2 games were because we got to brutalize evil. We could relive one of the great things the whole world was part of. And please dont say the nazi flag is meaningless. Because if it were, u wouldnt have went out of ur way to sterilize the game--despite the fact that its HALF the story of the struggle of ww2. Who is it ur trying to not offend? Ill redownload it when u guys get some perspective."
Svetlakov	5	November 13, 2020	TOOOOP
B G	5	November 13, 2020	A+
Mark Pedzinski	1	November 13, 2020	Crashes! Does nothing not even high end, 8gig ram smartphone! :-(
billel maasmi	5	November 13, 2020	The game is good and excellent for World War fans and old school students of strategy games. If you play Happy Farm before, this game does not concern you. This game is a model for those looking for strategic combat tactics and plans. R.U.S.E. fans will find your passion here. I think that the game will take the style of the legendary game Development Team Good luck, I support you 💣💣💣💣💣
Dalton Roberts	5	November 13, 2020	Ok
RTSK BOY	4	November 13, 2020	Good standard game
Name	3	November 13, 2020	Person that had the same problem and they said to try to unistalled and reinstall, ima try that quickly
the communist alpaca	5	November 13, 2020	Great unique game
A M	3	November 13, 2020	It's a Fun game, but the mechanics are pretty weird in my opinion. If this is the type of game you like get Rise Of Kingdoms, it is much better in almost every aspect.
Joseph Beaty	1	November 13, 2020	Would not load. Can't even try playing. I tried it on my data and on wifi. Unistalled it.
Steve Hinkle	2	November 13, 2020	Hoping it would be as good as rise of kingdoms but it's really lacking in a lot a ways, the gameplay is boring, hitting cities and attacking enemies has really no consequences which removes any depth or fun, in rise of kingdoms if you build strong and use good strategy you can really set enemies back which makes it exciting, also the story seems to draw upon social doctrines, I play games to get away from, it seems to be pandering to an audience the game won't even appeal to. Lilith failed.
Nicki Mitchell	5	November 13, 2020	I wish it for my device which is a samsung tablet 0.8
WeirdlyKrispy	4	November 13, 2020	Excellent game. There are a few little things they can add to better the game play but all in all its very enjoyable. However, I don’t know if its just me but I have to be connect to the wifi at home and can't just use my phones.
Nicholas disconnected	5	November 13, 2020	Honestly in love with this game only thing I want to see is this 1. A air force I would love to see airfights in with ww2 planes 2. Fortifications besides the bunker I would love soilders to build small defences that reduce damage 3. A mini base what I was thinking you could set it up anywhere it can be attacked by raven and players and there should be 2 barracks on it like a camp basicly but it has to be expensive in game resources so new players don't go all willie nillie with it
nukakid 420	1	November 13, 2020	I seen the ad for this game and I thought it would be a good game but I downloaded it and it said I couldn't even play it one star
Dave Waugh	1	November 13, 2020	Crashes before it starts
Zoey Dash	4	November 13, 2020	Great game for passing the time while ur stuck in a hospital bed
Miko Cantu	1	November 13, 2020	Will not load at all, you get a black screen after some foreign language appears. After that nothing. Can't give the game achance if you can't play it at all. This will make the game die off before they can even get started🤦.
Joshua Auman	1	November 13, 2020	There is not much to do. The game struggles to entertain honestly. The person who made the game has a good idea but there could be much more to make this game worth playing multiplayer warfare
Robert Wyn	1	November 13, 2020	About as much fun as watching mold grow
David Navarro	1	November 13, 2020	I have true 5G internet connection and I can't even connect to the game unless I'm connected to wifi. I hate how this is a mobile game and I need to be home to play it. I'll change my rating when this gets fixed. Otherwise it's a good game. But not worth not being able to go out and about. (Yes I've reinstalled the game multiple times) I have a Note 20 Ultra 5G with sprint/t-mobile North America Region
Deadmans Touch	1	November 13, 2020	Game won't load, which is fine since I don't get the point of the game.
Sebastian Wojnar Sr.	4	November 13, 2020	Cleared cache and data and reinstalled game and it works again. But on WiFi only so far weird.
Fred Engel	1	November 13, 2020	Don't work with my phone...2nd try still nothing
Rand All Thor	5	November 13, 2020	This game is just awesome! It's a little overwhelming in the beginning, but you soon get the hang of it. And if you are active, it absolutely possible to play without paying, as you get so good rewards from completing quest and tasks. If you are strategy and WW2 Fan this game is a must! I definitely highly recommend this 👍👍 Oh! Developers please fix a small bug that you still hear heroes talk (like faint from a neibour room) When all sound is turned off in game settings.
S L	1	November 13, 2020	Can't play on Android? Error says can't play on this device
Isaac Paul	1	November 13, 2020	Nothing like the commercials it advertises as a game where you can command every unit and win battles using cleavor tactics but really it is just another game like lords
Frog Gamer	1	November 13, 2020	Idk what its like but, I just can't play it after a month of ads I decided to download it and my device is not supported for this game I just felt disappointed
Yiz S	5	November 13, 2020	So far so good
Anime King	2	November 13, 2020	Not supported i hope it does in future updates
Mr Keg	4	November 13, 2020	It's very good but it needs a locating system with coordinates

Agus Wirya	1	November 13, 2020	Game not supported :( ,why?
Darkness /The King Of The Dark	4	November 13, 2020	Best game but can you make so you can get Ammo

Shanreka Yukhnov	5	November 13, 2020	Can't stop playing this game. But still need to wait for the energy to refill.
Qq Dd	5	November 13, 2020	amazing
maruv manson	5	November 13, 2020	Awesome graphic, gameplay, interface, and the story... Well done! KEEP IT UP!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
ILikeTheColorGreen13 _	4	November 13, 2020	Ah where do I start, this game is great! The introduction is wonderful and simple introducing you to the game and how to play. The campaign is very interesting and cool. Even though I barely started playing, so far. My base is leveling up pretty nicely and quickly while yes you can encounter some bugs, they're only a few. No game is perfect! I give this a 4/5
The Ex3 Guy	1	November 13, 2020	I want to play the game but when I enter the game there is a warning I can't play on the android pls fix it
Mylika Montford	5	November 13, 2020	Lots and lots of fun!!!
None Flight	2	November 13, 2020	Still experiencing log in issues, restarted 15+ times and still can't log in. good game love the concept,graphics and gameplay. One of a kind. Had to uninstall do too game freezing phone. Will reinstall after a update that hopefully fixes issue.

Marius Roznovan	5	November 13, 2020	Fresh mechanics and nice graphics giving this overused game genre a fresh breeze of air.
starwar fox	5	November 13, 2020	I do believe that you should fix the resources a little bit because I'm waiting so long just to get something done I would think that you would cut everything in half because sometimes I have to wait about 8 hours for one thing to get done
Ninnette Huyhton	5	November 13, 2020	I really look forward to this game !!
Michaiah Lory	5	November 13, 2020	The system is stable at any time
Akero	1	November 13, 2020	Makes the same mistake other games of the genre have very pay to win the certain items costing 30k gold or more very slow to actually get anywhere and then getting farmed buy ppl who pay hundreds of dollars just for better units and to skip researching
Charles Findish	1	November 13, 2020	Cant even find your own base...cant train troops...and no shield for new players...deleted game
CTFO Depot	1	November 13, 2020	Good game so far. Only gave 3 stars because I can't play on data, only wifi. Reply to Devs: It is not my phone or my connection since others have the same issue. I can play every game I have on data connection except yours. Optimize your game instead of telling users its their fault.
Cirino Crenshaw	5	November 13, 2020	Carefree and extraordinary.
sigit hp	5	November 13, 2020	Stunning graphics, same like the ad

Ahmed Attia	5	November 13, 2020	👍
Dicksie Gascoyen	5	November 13, 2020	I think the game is fun and it is worth playing.

David Allen	5	November 13, 2020	Having so much fun with this game.
Marion Mailes	5	November 13, 2020	It’s fun!
Efrant	5	November 13, 2020	This game is good but all i want is more chapters not in the campaign but the tasks ao i can get more officers and units for just doing tasks and im still confused why the rating is not above 4 stars yet
Sai Saisai	5	November 13, 2020	Www
treesmellwierd m8	4	November 13, 2020	Great game so recommend but the tutorial never ends and I wish when you are fighting you could take controll of you troops from a first person perspective other than that great game
Cgopuh Wiltsher	5	November 13, 2020	So much fun!!!!!!
Tulisa Studde	5	November 13, 2020	Like this game, it's fun
FBI Agent	1	November 13, 2020	I try to play warpath but everytime I try to play, it keeps saying, device not supported please try another device. I play on a Motorola G6 play
drag un	3	November 13, 2020	The only reason i am leaving 3 stars is because of the level istra where they FLOUD you with enimeis with no why to kill them
Himé Douji	1	November 13, 2020	Can't even play the game. Saying it is not supported on this device.
RICK KENNEDY	2	November 13, 2020	Play for an hour then run out of energy,, have to wait for hours to regenerate,,good concept, poor delivery, u can buy energy but really...gets really boring after hq 10 or so,,then it's just a waiting game
Tristen Davis	1	November 13, 2020	"Your ads had me believe gameplay would feel different. But if you want to know the real thing I hate about this it's history, if you like history or care at all about preservation of true events and persons you don't pussyfoot around and call the Nazis ""raven forces"". They're Nazis call them Nazis. Lest you wish to forget them and their acts and pass it off as some fantasy ""bad guys"""
Jasper Junior	5	November 13, 2020	SUPER amazing seriously the best strategy game ever! The only thing i hope. Is there a bomber in this game. If yes u guys are amazing. If no. Plz plz plz add it that will be amazing. A b17 would be nice. Ok thanks. Oh devs if your reading this plz add a bomber.
Corey C	4	November 13, 2020	Love this game so far, EXCEPT.....can the energy be replenished much quicker than 1pt for every 12 mins, more like 5pts every 12 would be better. And also lower the energy spent to collect resources. Your not gonna get anywhere fast having to wait/diminish your energy trying to build your base. Otherwise fun game been playing all day whe I can since the release.
Eilish Ehrat	5	November 13, 2020	Not bad!
SpyKnight	5	November 13, 2020	When I first started I thought it would be like all the other games of it would take forever to build everything but no. This game is something better It may be abot wonky on the controls as if you accidentally hit the screen your unit may have a problem but it did just come out. It's awesome and I'm in my own clan who is just starting to get big. Try the game out.
Umar Khan	4	November 13, 2020	Great game .
Brayden Boyd	5	November 13, 2020	I Love warpath
Jacob Rice	1	November 13, 2020	Can't play as the good guys. While I enjoy a subversion of expectations I wasn't a fan of this
Mue Harmour	5	November 13, 2020	The game style is very cool
Mknb Macgoun	5	November 13, 2020	so good i can't sleep.
Ionut M	5	November 13, 2020	Amazing game. I fell in love with it since first 15minutes. Amazing Open Map!
Ishya Abram	5	November 13, 2020	Stimulating and fun, really really good!
Joe Curr	1	November 13, 2020	OWNED BY CHINA LIKE JOE BIDEN. Pay to win trash.
V L	3	November 13, 2020	A rather good strategy game. Much similar to another game called Crossfire. There is nothing new in the gameplay so I found the game kinda boring. To be honest, it's definitely not something I would expect from Lilith. But you should still give it a try, it will not take long either.
Zimri Solan	5	November 14, 2020	It’s a good game!!! Just play it and you'll know what I'm saying.
Christian Freeman	1	November 14, 2020	Doesnt work for my devise

Ghost_Hat_Beats	1	November 14, 2020	"Says that its ""not supported for my device"". Help"
Selo ke Jamp as ooo	5	November 14, 2020	Cool
Muhammad Iqbal	4	November 14, 2020	Everything's good but it's not really historically accurate, like i saw in the campaign battle map there is a destroyed T-80 tank which is developed after ww2, and also i'm pretty sure i saw my troops using an AR-15 assault rifle, and also i saw the citadel guard character in the campaign dialogues holding an AK, also the aircraft noise when you call in airdrop sounds more like a jet than a propeller aircraft.
Kian Harbin	5	November 14, 2020	Excellent game I love it
Aiden Denham	5	November 14, 2020	This game for me is just amazing
Ban Me	3	November 14, 2020	I give it 3 star because i don't wanna hit any Allie guild during war against enemy.. you gotta do something for that ...
Grim Reaper	1	November 14, 2020	If i could give it 0 stars i would, cuz damn game aint supported on an LG ARISTO 4+ fix this and i might change my review.
Elaviene Davis	4	November 14, 2020	I like it but I thought it wasn't a pay to win
James Daniel	1	November 14, 2020	I HAVE a newer Samsung phone took for ever to download for when it was done still more to download and after all the time to download FINDLY I go to PLAY only to be told after a coup of hrs cant believe it took that long to download NO OTHER GAME SUCH AS ENVOY TO NO WHERE THAT LONG TO DOWN LOAD BUT BACK TO WARPATH TO ONLY BE TOOK AFTER THE DOWN AND READ ABOUT WARPATH THAT MY PHONE CAN NOT PLAY IT TO PICK ANOTHER PLATFORM AND THAT WAS AFTER THE LONG DOWNLOAD BUT NOT WORD IN THE SUBSCRIPTION
IMAN ZRH	5	November 14, 2020	Add more features fast Update...update...update
James Blevins	5	November 14, 2020	Best game you can get on mobile by far
Eduardo R-O	4	November 14, 2020	Do you get to choose a faction? Like the u.s. army or nazi?
Mr Tripod	5	November 14, 2020	Amazing

Larrie Wang	1	November 14, 2020	Loads forever, other games load faster. Never got to play this game once.
THE_ᑌDEᗩD_CORPSEE197 hh	1	November 14, 2020	This game could be good IF I would allow me to play when I open it it says game not supported on device please try another device can you please fix that then I'll consider a different star rating
papaturtle king	1	November 14, 2020	If i could i would rate 0 stars i cant even play i can download it then it says this app is not supported for this devise after it already downlaoded and i hit play
David Cortez	5	November 14, 2020	Love the game!!
Jordon Wagner	5	November 14, 2020	Ill give it a 5 even though I was never able to play it I have a Motorola E5 and the Android version is 8.1.0 but it says game not supported on this device. I'm wondering if that fix is in the works or not?
puugster0	5	November 14, 2020	Schlatt brought me hear. Give him more money. Pls
Muhammad Bilal	5	November 14, 2020	Very good game with tons of potential
George Nugent	1	November 14, 2020	It got very boring very quickly. Ads don't match gameplay in the slightest
Bryson Wood	1	November 14, 2020	"Worst game I've ever played giving it 1 star is me being kind, i have never written a bad review before. When the ""tutorial"" started I was attacked by another player and couldn't produce units to fight because of the reserve resource, so I can't produce units to defend myself and don't know how to get reserve without any units"
Hector Ayala	3	November 14, 2020	Was at 5 stars but realized can't play the game off of WIFI so thats a huge downer.
das auto	3	November 14, 2020	Fix the energy system i had full energy and wasn't able to pick up a drop from a lvl7 enemy
Lisabeth Dixon	5	November 14, 2020	LisabethDixon Save
Lynelle Parrish	1	November 14, 2020	Won't download at all...on Wi-Fi..nothing...
Adam Oliveras	3	November 14, 2020	Asking on a tiny survey about personal life. Is getting me a little worrisome. Also had experienced a glitch where YouTube went off and coincidentally constantly went up to discord. This app asked for a discord nametags before and it's a little suspicious.
Pawel Hawrylak	5	November 14, 2020	The game is just good
Даня Романов	2	November 14, 2020	not the best game cuz there are some bit inappropriate characters plus the trace and land are uglier then in adds
Cole Sultemeier	5	November 14, 2020	They sponsored TheRussianBadger, immediate 5 star havent even played yet
Al Ex	1	November 14, 2020	Boring Uninteresting and dosent let you play The game basically controls you By the fact youtubers are sponsoring this means it's bad and will ask for real money to actually have fun like RAID
Wyatt Woosley	1	November 14, 2020	Unfortunate it does not support my device. Yes my phone is old but every game I have played is playable. Please try and chnage this. I have an LG k20.
JasonMason FunTime	5	November 14, 2020	I like it
marky possom	5	November 14, 2020	This game is amazing so far easy to learn great graphics awesome storyline exited to see wht more will be in store
Neznajka Play	3	November 14, 2020	Has some interesting qualities but the tutorial start is too long, dull and shows all the ways this game is similar to so many other games already available.
Shane McManus	5	November 14, 2020	Very good, similar to other games such as Clash of Queens etc where you build up your base. The main difference here is the side missions and campaign that are all linked in. Very little waiting around for rewards etc as well. Good job so far!!!
jose cosme	3	November 14, 2020	I would rate this game higher but can only give it 3 stars due to not being able to play when not connected to WiFi. I have unlimited phone plan and this is only game I can't play when not on WiFi. The game is good just can't play outside of my home.
Chandler Cormier	3	November 14, 2020	So far so good, it's new though and a bit bare bones.
Cindy Smith	4	November 14, 2020	My one complaint is that your tiger tank is a Porsche tiger
THEO Abi hanna	5	November 14, 2020	Is app is good
Brandon Woolsey	1	November 14, 2020	Terrible I can't even play the game because I get an error message saying it can't connect to the network but I have full service
Ryan Pruitt	1	November 14, 2020	Why is it on phone if you can't play it on the phone
GAME!! FUN !	5	November 14, 2020	good
Kevin Alvarez	5	November 14, 2020	Awesome!!!!
Liliana Cerda	4	November 14, 2020	Love the game...but there's one thing can you make the graphics better because mine looks not really good...or maybe it's just my phone cause it is a Samsung galaxy amp prime 3.
Brandon Vega	5	November 14, 2020	I like to join in the battle.
aec markets	1	November 14, 2020	Difficult to understand so I uninstalled it
Peekiepeeks	3	November 14, 2020	Why have it in the app store if its not suported on my device
Steven Rice	3	November 14, 2020	Great game. Only problem so far is that I can't get through log in screen with my phones network. I have to be on wifi
Gamer_kidz	5	November 14, 2020	It is awesome all I do all day
Francisco Cabbllero	5	November 14, 2020	Best game i ever played <3
Amy Cadwallader	5	November 14, 2020	Good game! Graphics you would never forgive. You download what it shows. It shows everything you would want in a stray game. Download. You won't regret it or me. Thx!!!!!!!!!
flametrooper 522	5	November 14, 2020	I like were this is going and I hope that they continue this and hopefully do a good job 👍
Dutch Van Der Linde	2	November 14, 2020	Ok so this game looks interesting but apparently its not compatible with my device
Meanmachine 237	1	November 14, 2020	I can't play it because it is not supported on my device but it looks cool
ken myers	4	November 14, 2020	It's a different kind of war game. Good
Aura The Draak	1	November 14, 2020	Don't need to have a game taking my picture or hearing my conversations, no game asked for those permissions.
code 002	5	November 14, 2020	Good game and fun
Timothy Weese	1	November 14, 2020	Won't play....says not compatible with device...i own a L G Neon
Bender B	2	November 14, 2020	It's ok, game play it is better than most base builders. How ever they made up an enemy... It's clearly sapoae to be the Nazi's how ever they changed to leader from Hitler and any Nazi symbols are changed to a red and black eagle. For a game set in the time of the greatest generation,coupled with the fact that a large number of our own youth don't even know there was a holucost or what it was, this game should be more accurate. Do better.
plague doctor 2.0	1	November 14, 2020	Dumb why are these games still around
Destany Bennett	5	November 14, 2020	Cool game
Ron Valdespino	1	November 14, 2020	This game sucks a high level lost to a low level in the game worst games in 2020 plz fix the stupid battle rating ever putting this on YouTube to talk about how bad this game is
Apple Master	5	November 14, 2020	Im glad this is not p2w. You dont need to wait 5 years for one building upgrade it takes 0 seconds to upgrade. And is ww2 based and ik a lot about the gund planes and tansk of ww2. Very awesome
Lemon L0rd	1	November 14, 2020	Not for tablet and doesn't put a warning saying that it isn't optimised for my device, used my data now I'm sad
Omaira Luciano	1	November 14, 2020	can't play it stay black n Chinese words come out but still no down load please fix
Max Castle	1	November 14, 2020	Giving you a 1 star because i know this is another hong kong cash grab. Just because you gave jontron money to advertise your game doesn't mean it's good. It means you're lying to the customer base about how mediocre it is and lacks actual gameplay. Serious you hong kong game company are all the same, if i president i would ban all mobile games from Asia. Stay out of my feed and i hope you suffer like raid: israel funder.
Aaron Reisetter	1	November 14, 2020	Its not loading. I will open the app and it will ask to update, and I would. And then it would stop loading, and just freeze. Please help.
House_Lifeowner Stuka	1	November 14, 2020	Not optimal for my tablet and it looks so fun.
SQUISH OwO	4	November 14, 2020	It's a good game to play, but I do wish that research and energy refills were faster, as it makes it feel more like a waiting game, but I am glad that they made it semi-instant build/upgrade
Berry Tan	1	November 14, 2020	From 3.7 jump to 4.8 overnight, don't tell me this is legit
Jason Edwards Jr	5	November 14, 2020	I love this game it's fun
dragonlord 360	1	November 14, 2020	Cant even play
Esther Kirk	1	November 14, 2020	I cant play it bcuse it said that this game is not abel on this phon
Robert Guzman	1	November 14, 2020	It's not like it's advertised.
Scary Club	2	November 14, 2020	why is it for chromebook only
Jason Engle	4	November 14, 2020	Everything is great just wish the research was less time costly and the camp unit chests were easier to get and I wouldn't mind better draw rates for higher star units.
Alejandro Villarreal	1	November 14, 2020	It won't let me play
Cody Dehn	1	November 14, 2020	Heard this game was good but downloaded it n won't even let me on keeps freezing when loading so no stars had pick 1star to post that don't count
robert romano	1	November 14, 2020	Game won't open.
Rexo Derio	1	November 14, 2020	Next time don't lie and say its moblie playable fact that some of moblie devices cant play is stupid and why did y'all lie?
Nathanael Edric	5	November 14, 2020	This a really good ww2 strategy game unlike other ww2 games I played this is better the only thing I want as a unit is Schwerer Gustav the rail super gun because that would be awesome! If you can't add that I will still love the game and the campaign mode but I called it the story mode is actually fun and realistic.
kngkllr463	1	November 14, 2020	Released it and it's not compatible
Gabriel Bromley	1	November 14, 2020	"Could you have it available on all phones. I would love to play the game, but can't since it's not ""compatible"" with my phone."
Azerin 345	2	November 14, 2020	"I really wanna play this game and I was super happy when I saw it was done downloading but after opening the game all I got to read was ""Game not supported on device"" :("
Ivaniel Roman	5	November 14, 2020	Just awesome no negative comments
RAY	5	November 14, 2020	Love it probably the best mobile strategy game I've played yet keep up the good work and I'd like to see aerial units as well besides scouts (suggestion):bombers to weaken the enemy ravens on the map (but at a price of recourses for game balance)
Ping Vape Karawang	1	November 14, 2020	Too hard to get material >:(
Popbomber	3	November 14, 2020	It has a great story, very nice story telling, however I feel like they're focusing a lot on promotion, as almost every video I have watched today has been sponsored by Warpath, which is totally fine. I get it. But, if this continues, it's just going to be another Raid: Shadow Legends. Also, the gameplay is quite repetitive in some areas, and I can't play for more than an hour without getting bored and doing something else.
south Texas fishing	5	November 14, 2020	Brilliant

temoc rosas	5	November 14, 2020	I am enjoying this game it had kept mr busy and affordable buy in packages.. Hopefully they add more characters
Roman Esquivias	5	November 14, 2020	I do support you channel
Jim Tom	1	November 14, 2020	Well i cant get it to download! It could be to advanced for the phone. The game before i tried to download or after worked fine.
Brian Kritcher	5	November 14, 2020	I really love this game. You don't have to wait for your buildings to upgrade you just get the materials and it upgrades right now. The developers were very generous this is not a pay to win game. What we really need is more players. We have a good chunk of people but it's spread across all languages so it's not a very multiplayer experience until we get more people. At least for those of us who only speak one language. Maybe install a translator for the city chat.

Braeden The Third	1	November 6, 2020	I did not even install this and straight away I see screenshots from Minecraft in the images. People are just so desperate to become popular these days. Please, if you are going to make a game like Minecraft, change at least a few things that are obvious so that it does not appear as an off brand Minecraft. I would say though, if you did add some changes in graphics, and maybe different things. I would rate 4 at least by then.

TheAmazeEmojiNinja	2	November 6, 2020	Okay, so first of all, the pictures are just fake. It is clear that the gun and the hotbar and other stuff have been photoshopped onto a random picture you took in game in Minecraft. The actual game is decent, but it could use some work. However, the pictures shown to depict what the game looks like is clearly fake.

Jeff Grusky	3	November 7, 2020	Review from an adult: This game is clearly a cash grab, however, it's actually a lot more well made that i imagined based on the fake screenshots. My first impression based on the games play store page was that it was gonna be some 2d shooter with minecraft screenshots as the background but it was actually a fully fledged blocky shooting game. Probably uses some stolen game engine tbh.

mega steve1225	1	November 8, 2020	"What ever you do DO NOT DOWNLOAD. The ad i saw was a part of a animated youtube series called ""blocking dead"" by black plasma studios. Which means they stole it from them. This is also a clone of hypixel's crafting dead minigame. So please dont support these guys who are too lazy to make an ad."

Pls fix the game.....
Jo Gilliard	5	November 10, 2020	This is bassicly a copy of minecraft, but i can tell it has its own kind of creativity that minecraft doesn't. Over all the add rate is fine and this game is pretty fun, so enjoy your 5⭐

Biggy Cheas	1	November 11, 2020	Terrible game not nearly as epic as the avertisment speaking of advertisements have you heard of RAID: Shadow Legends™️ is an immersive online experience with everything you'd expect from a brand new RPG title. It's got an amazing storyline, awesome 3D graphics, giant boss fights, PVP battles, and hundreds of never before seen champions to collect and customize. I never expected to get this level of performance out of a mobile game. Look how crazy the level of detail is on these champions!

I never accessed my device, nor authorized you at anytime before last month nor during my pause from my device to charge me for anything. The only reason I found out is because Google emailed the receipt. I have the refund now. DON'T BE THIEVES. One star all around.

Cassandra Munoz	5	November 2, 2020	It dus not let me pley
Gaige Obst	1	November 3, 2020	Just genuinely not fun. It is far too easy and provides 0 challenge
Janie Huntley	1	November 3, 2020	I cant even go into the game it will just bring me back to home DO NOT GET THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF STOROGE
Chris Elmore	3	November 3, 2020	Pretty fun game just lots of ads
Rachel Luna	3	November 4, 2020	So, first of all theres ads like evry 2 levels. Also the game is really laggy, and my screen kept on freezing, honestly it's kinda boring too. Only get this game if you want to waste your time
HipProGamer	2	November 4, 2020	Somewhat fun but I used airplane mode to get rid of the annoying ads. The reason it's not getting 3 stars is because the levels are short and easy but after 100 levels they start to repeat themselves
Highawk19	5	November 4, 2020	I only bought this to torture him

Sharnaide Weston	4	November 5, 2020	Its Quit Good not gonna lie😁
Alysia Gonzalez	3	November 6, 2020	This game has the potential to be a fun game. But the lags suck. I haven't beat the 2nd level because it glitches and I keep flying everywhere and dying. Put more effort into this game and I might consider redownloading. Giving you three stars is being generous.
Dark Rainbow	4	November 6, 2020	Not bad. Get's boring after a while but other then that it's great.
Lion Beats Production	1	November 6, 2020	Way too many ads
Super foxy Bros	4	November 6, 2020	I would give it a 5 but I cant because on some levels you can just beat very easily so like level 53 you can do this hand trick or glitch and you can just press the final button so please fix that because the characters color wont change if you do the glitch so I gave it a 4 but it's still a very good and simple game.
ManWithAVan	1	November 6, 2020	Very boring and tutorials are too revealing
Kaiden Pavis	5	November 6, 2020	It is a fantastic game and can you stop adds every 2 levels

Scoops Ropes	1	November 8, 2020	STOP SENDING ME YOUR ADS PLS
Kitty Mc	2	November 8, 2020	its an ok game, and a pretty ok concept but it is very glitchy, i cannot get past level 46 without it glitching all over the place, the ads are very annoying and the game is too easy

Niclas Pasetti	2	November 10, 2020	If you love ads then it's a 5.
random animator updates	4	November 10, 2020	Its gr8! Has potential. It could be better with less ads, or like only ads when you skip a level, or sometimes there could be special ad offers for power ups like double stretch,or saw hands to break boxes. And you could make powers cost money like some sorta jump power. Yknow, maybe that could replace an ad after every level
David Smith	5	November 10, 2020	I love this game its so funny
cozetta henriques	5	November 10, 2020	It's nice but mone does add and then when I come back mine is dead

Cassowary	3	November 10, 2020	Descent game but it's not worth 50% bring ads
Brittany Hobbs	5	November 10, 2020	I like this game but it has a lot of ads even though I still like the game a lot
Victoria Moored	1	November 10, 2020	Too many adds

Aurora Thorosn	2	November 10, 2020	It's a good game but like all other games like this WAY TO MANY ADS. You play for like for 1.5 seconds then a 30 second ad. I do not recommend this game if you hate ads like me.
Alejandro Carrera	1	November 10, 2020	Crashes immediately on pixel 4a.
John Doe	1	November 10, 2020	I get that you make money off ads but there are way too many.. Uninstalled after about 2 minutes.
Life With Perry	2	November 10, 2020	Ok the game was fun at first but when you fail you get so many ads I would get 3 ads per fail but I dont want to watch a 30 second ad for a cheap game
the good the bad	5	November 10, 2020	Add challing levels like fast reacting levels!
Mahdi Pirnajmoddin	1	November 10, 2020	Game make me see ads rapidly after just 15 second

Eliasmoh Gaming	5	November 10, 2020	I'm addicted now lol
Alex Gilbert	1	November 10, 2020	This game is bad because when you move the limbs even a tiny bit they go everywhere and kill you
Alexander Nock	1	November 10, 2020	Even as ad farms go, this game is unacceptably bad. The graphics lag so much during normal use, that the game is literally unplayable.
Keldon Stevers	5	November 10, 2020	These a*#^#^%$@% are mean to you, five stars for the GREAT GAME! AMAZING!

Shineka Allen	5	November 11, 2020	I can't download it
withered foxy	2	November 11, 2020	It lays way too laggy but I give it a 2 because its fun
charles howington	4	November 11, 2020	"Just because the ad is ""skippable"" doesn't mean there should be one after every level."
Lolmaster Bruhboi	2	November 11, 2020	The game is good but the lag makes me want to throw my phone. I can't even beat level 2!
Bj G	5	November 11, 2020	Its basically spider man sim
pickle juice	2	November 11, 2020	It would be a lot more fun if it was not so laggy, and do you really need an add after every single level? It gets annoying, and they are the same adds every time.
mr 3	1	November 11, 2020	This game is trash because the lags and the adds and i cant even move without dying
darryl Long	5	November 11, 2020	Love it it's the best but to much adds

Flock oꟻ Feathers	4	November 11, 2020	I love this game it's simple and fun to play but can you please add more skins because it's kinda boring playing with the same thing over and over again but anyways it's a good game 😁❤️
Casey Rule	2	November 11, 2020	It is very laggy and there are lots of adds.
Kelsey Brady	1	November 11, 2020	Your game is bad i cant even male it past level 6 its that bad this is trash
Robert	1	November 11, 2020	30 second ads for 10 seconds of game play, left after the fourth level after only playing for about 20 seconds and a second 30 second ad popping up. Be realistic.
Larry Villa	5	November 11, 2020	...l..ll Love it
ßr3ñ† muΠr03	2	November 11, 2020	This game is so bad. One: It is too laggy. Two) i try to get a new skin by watching an ad and it won't let me. Three) there is too many ads, you get ads like once every 2 deaths which is so annoying. Four) I die way too easily. I try to stretch him a bit and then his limbs goes everywhere and then i die, even though i didnt make the limb go too far.
Leo Mcanally	5	November 11, 2020	Strecky Senky boi
Melissa Manore	5	November 11, 2020	Ok

Tyson Webster	1	November 11, 2020	Reeeeeeee
maxamoose7 :P	4	November 11, 2020	Amazing game and actully fun but past level 120 it gets too laggy to do anything.
Guy Roy	3	November 11, 2020	This game is lots of fun. It is simple and cute. My only problem is that at some point, the levels keep repeating. So you end up playing the same levels over and over. Appart from that, its fun.
Cleavon Sowell	5	November 11, 2020	Cool game!
JJ Walker	1	November 11, 2020	The object of the game is great but there is an ad after EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL. I cant take it. Plus at one point, the game just stopped. And i tried to check if my internet was working and i couldnt even press anything on my phone. This game is very bad and i dont recommend it.
Dylan pearson	1	November 11, 2020	Worst game ever its imsobbible to win level 4 this is just another game that wants my money

exotic butters123	1	November 12, 2020	After a certain level, it just repeats old levels
Julie DUNCAN	1	November 12, 2020	I hate it. It glitches SO that I can't finish it. I move it a little bit, then it makes it go ALL the way to the other wall and he dies. And most of the time right before he dies his arm is stuck INSIDE the wall. SO I'M ONLY ON LEVEL TEN!! Or I was before I DELETED it. Don't waste your time.
Zoe Bowling	5	November 12, 2020	is rely good sow yes am a big fan
Julian Harford	3	November 12, 2020	An ok game ruined by advert spam
Sophia Bermudez	5	November 12, 2020	This game is so fun it's just funny montis
Alex McGinn	1	November 12, 2020	Sucks. I cant play the game. It starts, but you cant do anything.
The legendary	2	November 12, 2020	Dont know y but wont let me install just says there is error
GrayWolf Gaming	2	November 12, 2020	I gave it a two star because I can't get past level 3 because every time I try to move it flings his arm into one of the blades or stretches him to far. Like when I was on level 2 it flung his arm through the wall and he exaploded so please fix the glitch ao I can make it past level 3 and I will change my review
Pardes Nawabi	5	November 12, 2020	This game no smart than me!
CAC Headstart	5	November 12, 2020	This is a good game

Stephanie Bowick	1	November 12, 2020	The controles are trash cant even get past level two on mobile
master gaming	1	November 12, 2020	SO MANY ADS EVERYTHING YOU DO THERE IS AN AD I WAS A GAME CREATOR BEFORE AND THIS IS SO STUPID DUD GREADY PEOPLE JUST WANT MONEY THEY DON'T EVEN LET YOU ENJOY THE GAME I MADE A GAME CALLED DELIVERY OUTLAW BUT IT WAS OUTDATED SO I GOT RID OF IT AND IT WAS THE NUMBER 1 GAME FOR 3 YEARS BACUSE I PUT ADS FOR SPEASHAL DEALS SO YOU HAD TO CHOOSE IF YOU WANTED TO WACH THE AD NOT FORCE PEOPLE TO WACH IT BUT THERE WHERE ADS FOR EVERY 5 LEVEL YOU PASS (REPLY TO ME IF YOU REMEMBER dilevery outlaw)
Will	4	November 12, 2020	It's actually pretty good, the levels aren't that hard so you go threw them quite fast. The problem is, there's basically an ad after every level and the levels start repeating around lvl 186
axolotl	4	November 12, 2020	This game is fun but there are a few things 1. The character's hand gets stuck in the walls every now and then. 2. After level 171 the levels start to repeat. But besides that it's a fun game Also for people who don't like ads you can avoid them by putting on air plane mode
Modestas Kriunas	4	November 12, 2020	The only problem is ads.
Zac Gibson	1	November 12, 2020	I HATE OUY its sooooo sooooo soooo laggy i keep dieing and i hate it

benjamin Cid	5	November 13, 2020	This is a good game but it is kanda hard my mom said that this game is not for kids
peter wood	1	November 13, 2020	OMG!!! COMPLETE AND UTTER AD FEST!!! If you love ads, you'll love this game. Total junk.
Faiza Bashir	5	November 13, 2020	It's a nice game but my 1 problem is I have is when you reach level 170 it keeps on repeating the same levels and at the point you might as well uninstall the game.Adds aren't really a problem I just turn off Wi-Fi to keep my sanity in lockdown
Mitchell Bottomley	1	November 13, 2020	Ad farm
nicola greene	1	November 13, 2020	Super laggy
Pey_Day08	2	November 13, 2020	Wasn't bad until every nanosecond you'd get an ad and then for some reason severe lag spikes.
Leeland Sparks	5	November 13, 2020	Good
Matthew Nacoste	5	November 13, 2020	Its gr8
Haley Cannon	1	November 13, 2020	It kept getting stuck on the first level and wouldn't let me click on anything
Leah Galbraith	2	November 13, 2020	The game has a nice concept, BUT THERE IS ONE BIG PROBLEM. THE GAME CONSTANTLY HAS ADS! You can barely go a minute without an ad. If the developers of this game could somehow fix the amount of ads i would gladly reinstall this app.
Dalton Hill	1	November 13, 2020	Too much lag.

Jen Sawyer	1	November 13, 2020	Horrible game. It can be fun, but THERE'S ADS AFTER. EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL. I don't recommend it.
yay for me e	1	November 13, 2020	I can't get pass level one. No, it's not because I'm brain dead. It's because the game is DAMN TOO LAGGY! I try to stretch him, and the game just freezes, like wth??
David Calley	1	November 14, 2020	I hate this game it's so laggy and it won't let me do anything before I die. 1 way I die is I move a little and I die please fix this glitch.
Rodney Davis	5	November 14, 2020	Please work
Alex Tierney	1	November 14, 2020	I played for about 30 seconds deleted it, I couldn't do anything, it was too laggy, I would give 0 if I could

Rachel Likes Gacha life	1	November 14, 2020	Third level. I have the guy grab the ball, and his arms go all over the place and die. This us terrible.
Vanessa Hooper	5	November 14, 2020	I really like the game but it has a few stuff but I don't like but good job game
Fat Nava	5	November 14, 2020	It's Really funny and graphics are nice
Bader AlShakhatrah	2	November 14, 2020	Too many ads , I spent more time in skipping ads than time playing to get to level 7. The game might be interesting on higher levels, but I would have to watch 100 ads by then 😂
Sierra Weston	4	November 14, 2020	the game is a bit harder every level, but thats typical for a regular mobile game. Im not too happy about all the ads, but you have to remember that it is a free game. I think it is very addicting and fun.
Ahm Ed	4	November 14, 2020	👍👍👍❣ Ich bin so 😵Das ist Tool ja.
Kristen Kcrafter	2	November 14, 2020	The concept is great but it was frozen when I first entered the game. I got it to work, but it was so laggy and if I tried to move on limb just a tiny bit everything stretches and I die for no reason. It is just so frustrating and if I click skip it does nothing! Please fix this! 😖
Samuel stehling	1	November 14, 2020	Doesn't even work I move on arm and then it stops working
Barking Cat	1	November 14, 2020	It suck crappy POOPOO peepee boobies
-ShadowHuntZ-	3	November 14, 2020	Its a good game, but as other reviews say, there are a lot of ads, and I found a glitch where if you stretch the guy upside down his face is distorted. It also makes my phone lag and get hot, even though it is not even a CPU intensive game. Needs more optimisation.
Devonte Bartholomew	1	November 14, 2020	This game those not work at all
madison klein	1	November 14, 2020	I see other people's comments so I feel like it's gonna be bad
The Gaming Fan 3926	1	November 14, 2020	DID YOU EVEN TEST THE GAME?!?! THE CONFIGURATION SAYS 'if they move it slightly, move it to every corner of the screen' IT'S NOT FUN! THE AD LIES!
Brock Lavallee	1	November 14, 2020	I gave this game a one star review because it's so laggy and it has so much ads and why do most companys make such bad mobile games it's obvious there doing this just for the money I do not recommend this game
Joselyn Herrera	1	November 14, 2020	I dont like it 1 resen is that to werdo and he kill more then one time 2 he laggy 3 he is red
lilboss 1234	2	November 14, 2020	The game is so lagy and the game would be better if they had less ads there is an add every time you die and level 6 is so hard i can not put the ball in
Lisa Allen	1	November 14, 2020	Very glitch It's to glitchy for me to to play when ever I take a leg or arm off a wall he dies!
Kenya Johnson	1	November 14, 2020	This game is so trash that each time when I press on him he just glitches so it's basically like this I tap on him glitches out I try slow still glitches😤 everyone is right about this game lag so much ads
Noah Botting	2	November 14, 2020	It would be at least a four star because it's a cool idea but there is no tutorial system whatsoever so I have to skip every level with a switch because I don't know how to operate them and I'm only on level six.
Cory Clark	1	November 14, 2020	way to lagy on 16 i could not even play.
Sunbird	1	November 14, 2020	You know a games bad when the main mechanic (moving the guys arms) doesnt even work
Aiden Zheng	1	November 14, 2020	Its Soo laggy I can't even play it
Prince Oshan	5	November 14, 2020	It's a fun game
The KitKitty	3	November 14, 2020	i love it...i really do
Naimah Ford	1	November 14, 2020	This game lags so much and has so much ads. I was on level 10 and I was tryna get to the safe spot but every time I tried moving my arm to a certain spot it would lag and then I would die 😡🤬. Also you get the same ads. Please fix it and I will give 5 stars.
Maria Granados	5	November 14, 2020	Funny game👍🤓
Sir Lamb Chops	5	November 14, 2020	Great game, but could you add a way to go back to previous levels?
BromMobileIpad	5	November 14, 2020	That app is have ads and that was 1
AimanRizky Explore	5	November 14, 2020	Easy level and the guy is so funny thats why i give 5 star
Julia Dills	4	November 14, 2020	I rate it this high because its gun and because it is making the man hurt so I do 4 stars😉
Anton Schauble	2	November 14, 2020	Not nearly interesting enough to justify sitting through all those ads.
Marie Claire	5	November 14, 2020	Im Like to play dis game
Fatmata Jalloh	1	November 3, 2020	this game is kind of not fun
Bobbi Montgomery	4	November 3, 2020	Lots of ads but fun
Lexie Clark	3	November 3, 2020	Its a really nice game! I get a couple adds here and there but it doesn't bother me. I feel like it's a nice easy game.. but I feel like it's too easy. It would be nice if it let the play do most of the work. I go around the cuticle area and I cant even go down the nail with it completely finishing for me and with the polishing. That kinda took the fun out of it. Other than that its a good game.. but its too too easy.
Zanya Daniels	5	November 3, 2020	💗💗💙💙💙💗💙💙💗💙💙💗
Daisy Huang	3	November 3, 2020	Its very laggy i tough it will be interesting but its bad
Makayla Dial	1	November 3, 2020	Way to many adds can't even play the game .
Angelina Gooch	3	November 3, 2020	If was relaxing but very elementary. Probably good for young children.
Gwendolyn Sims	5	November 3, 2020	It lets me do everything even if they was something they they want something I can give them anything.
AleyahJane Palomo	5	November 3, 2020	I love it
Clara PAEZ	5	November 3, 2020	I like it bc it helps u have nalige and smart and it helps u how u want your nails to be it is basically awesome
LaKeisha Bowman-Oliver	5	November 3, 2020	Love playing this game and doing the different designs for the nails.
Mantala Princess	5	November 3, 2020	Amazing 😊👍✨
Teana Patton	1	November 3, 2020	To many ads
Kennadi Carroll	1	November 3, 2020	I don't like it I gave it A 1 star
Softly Arii	3	November 3, 2020	Hello people! This game is so gorgeous and high in graphics but here's the dumb part I can't add any furniture anymore it's just stuck please fix it asap and too many ads uhhh please let me add furniture thank you
Karen S	1	November 3, 2020	Too many ads!
RainaRavenwood	1	November 3, 2020	Literally everything you click has an ad, every time, even in the middle of doing the nails. I had this downloaded for less than five minutes, and about four and a half of those minutes were ads.
Meg Dunne	4	November 3, 2020	I really like the game I just think you could add more to it to make it more fun a realistic make it more like a actually acrylic nail saloons
Hope Johnson	2	November 3, 2020	It wont let me get this app for some reason
Tim Fentress	5	November 3, 2020	In life I start installation game it's from the fighting it's a Halloween looking for in one whole game it's fine
sleepy sheep	1	November 3, 2020	Every time I send Chanel it goes to an ad every single time
Catherine Ramos	1	November 3, 2020	Alot of ads even if you click no to watching an ad to double points it still makes you watch the ad and doesn't double points. Can't get through 1 step without having to watch ads.
Brittney Smith	5	November 4, 2020	Soooo cool
Arhya Harris	3	November 4, 2020	It's okay but the glitches and too many ad's
Elizabeth DeMeyer	4	November 4, 2020	Its cute. It sould be more realistic. Meaning when the client comes in they should say what shape and color and if they want a sentcil or decoration. Other than that. Its ok.
Fleeky Lady	1	November 4, 2020	TOO MUCH ADS
Samantha Shuey	2	November 4, 2020	I had high hopes for this game, especially when all I could see for a few months that it was pre-order only. So you would expect people to reveiw it or at least, talk the makers right ?. I feel this needed more work, its slightly bugy and also a tad concerning. The nail work/art I did basically kept getting into my gallary, even though no bubble/box said it needed my gallary. I don't know if I trust something that doesn't notify me that it needs something then, find out its doing something odd.
Brian Brown	1	November 4, 2020	There are a lot of ads. and 1 time it kicked me out and didn't save any of my process
Myla McCoy	1	November 4, 2020	I HATE this game it's way to laggy it was way to many adds and I hate how it just saves the picture of the nails in my camera roll automatically 👁👄👁
RAJA DA	5	November 4, 2020	Wow.............................,.... No word
DreamyyEclipse	4	November 4, 2020	I like it but there's too much ads
Madeline Blevins	1	November 4, 2020	The amount of ads is out of control. Takes away from any of it being fun. Will be deleting after I post this
vaishali nangare	2	November 4, 2020	😑😑😑
GodLike Oreos	4	November 4, 2020	Its a good game but its a bit laggy
Haley Sarvaiya	3	November 4, 2020	They do not allow you to pay a small lump sum of money to get rid of ads. It will not let you fully customize the nails. Lime I wanted 1 flower for 1 accent nail but it did 3 flowers on all the nails. It needs work.
oceanwxves	3	November 4, 2020	There is lots of lag and adds but overall its a fun game
Ginger Minor	1	November 4, 2020	Sooooo fun😁😁😁😄🤗🤗🤗
Yelly Jelly	5	November 4, 2020	i love this game you win so many things and i love doing nails
Carmen Hooten	5	November 4, 2020	I love this game😊😊
Pearl Pedroza	2	November 4, 2020	Its slow
Autumn Smith	5	November 4, 2020	It is really good it doesn't lag and it's very relaxing but it's hard to move the controls
Natalia Sumey	1	November 4, 2020	Honestly this game sucks! I wish I could give it less than 1 star, that's how bad it is! It made my entire phone slow and glitchy! It has waaaaay too many ads! During the manicure there are ads that pop up, and after each person you give a manicure to there is an ad. Also the process of giving the manicure is really hard because the tools (paint brushes and the drill) don't line up with your finger. I 100% recomend that you DO NOT DOWNLOAD this app! DISCLAIMER: THIS IS MY HONEST OPINION!
Jean Ferrell	5	November 4, 2020	This is super fun
Deonna Scott	5	November 4, 2020	I love it because it let me knlw hlw to do it better

Lawrence Owusu	1	November 4, 2020	There is too much apps and it's slow.
Libby Melton	5	November 4, 2020	"I love the game and graphics! They're all so realistic! I see a lot of reviews about ""way too many ads."" But there really aren't. Basically the only ads I got were after shaping the nails. There are so many bright colors! I like how you earn the stuff yourself, and you don't just get it at the start. Please download this its amazing!"
Nerd Girl	3	November 4, 2020	lags awfully and so many adds and the controlls are awful and so hard to controll unless your ok withdealing with all of this I would not get this app. It was a fun idea but you need to fix those bugs
A Google user	1	November 4, 2020	Ugh, to many ads and not a very playable game. Limited choices and very bad quality.
Hailey Weltz	1	November 4, 2020	Honestly this game sucks nothing like the real thing,to many ads,puts things in your gallery,and its super laggy.
Mistie-Anna Tuttle	4	November 4, 2020	There are a lot of ads like any other game like this but I really like the freedom to do whatever design you want for the most part and it saves so the designs you do to your gallery

Guadalupe Ruiz	4	November 4, 2020	Its a fun game with nails stuff way better than real nail polish real nail polish really stinks a lot and you buy the stuff even the remover for nails so i like this game no spending money so cool i do rate it so i dont have to anymore so yeah its just like school share what you wanna say
Randi Wallace	1	November 4, 2020	Way too many ads. I can't even finish one nail before they pop up. Not worth download if you can't get through one level without an ad.

Katrina Chamberlain	3	November 4, 2020	While the graphics are good, theres alot of ads. I completed 3 clients before I deleted it due to the ads.
Shabomb	1	November 4, 2020	"WAY TOO MANY ADS I have gone through maybe 6 nails before uninstalling. After almost every step there is an ad. You have the option to hit ""watch video for double coins"" or no and even if you hit no you're stuck watching an ad. I know I'm not the only one that finds that extremely annoying. And than my phone started overheating like wth. This game would be fun if it wasn't a constant billboard for other games."
my favorite song Cortez	5	November 4, 2020	Ok
Tabby Howell	1	November 4, 2020	I wish the game had let u choose if u wanted both an acsesory and stencil. Also way to many videos I do expect some videos but not 1 every minute or so. The game was also very laggy. It also saves the pitcures to your camera roll without asking.
Isabella Henry	1	November 4, 2020	Boring, WAY too many ads
shaderfaderf	2	November 4, 2020	not like doing real nails at all. control of the brushes and drills are wonky and not correalated with where youre touching the screen. WAY too many ads.

fiona harrison	1	November 5, 2020	Promising game spoiled by adverts
Chërry_Tea	2	November 5, 2020	This game is fun and enjoybal but is is very laggy
lila Greendale	1	November 5, 2020	The games really stupid to me because there's way to many ads that are mostly inappropriate or dumb nothing really good, it's also super boring because you have to just tapping and swiping in a very boring way and you dont get to do alot, and it take forever to get a new color but I'm inpatient so ya, but this is only my opinion so try it if you want I just dont like it at all.
Evyn B	1	November 5, 2020	Too many ads, now when I get a ad you csn't close the ad it just stays until you click on the ad, the game is overall boring.
Laurraine Hight	5	November 5, 2020	I think that all of the games are 😎

Willow Jacqueline	1	November 5, 2020	I deleted this 4minutes after I downloaded it. There's wayy to many ads.
Sara Proano	3	November 5, 2020	I mean, the graphics could be better. There's tons of adds, and you only get a limited amount of choices, but all in all, it's actually kinda fun! You get to design your unique kind of nail, even if at first there's only a few combos you can make, and I don't know, it just has this entertaining feel in general. I would probably add the other two stars if you limited the adds a tad, improved the graphics a little so things don't clip, and add a few more coloring options that are consistent.
Josie Abraham	1	November 5, 2020	This game saves all the nails that I've painted to my photos and didn't even ask for permission to use my photos app.
Pamela Mays	3	November 5, 2020	I can't get past the first level without it kicking me out every time

Mythical Lex	1	November 5, 2020	It was taking pictures of every manicure that i did without my knowledge or consent. It mentioned NOTHING about this in the adds or description, it also has ALOT of adds in the app itself. 1-5 i would not recommend.
Sydney Goble	1	November 5, 2020	Not worth the download. Should require some actual skill and be harder. Also you should have to actually do the nails yourself not have an automated stop for you thing so you aren't actually doing anything. Pointless. Way worse than I expected.
dee kurth	5	November 5, 2020	I like it
Funny Bunny	1	November 5, 2020	I literally couldnt do anything. The app kept closing on me.
Ava Grassing	4	November 5, 2020	When i finish a customers nails i didnt know the game saves the nail pictures to my phone and it takes up camera storage

sharon bennett	1	November 5, 2020	To be honest I hate hate comments, but this took over half an hour to load and it was so laggy and glitchy, 30 minutes waste of time. I'm not forcing you to do anything but this is a bad game in my opinion (not to be a Karen)
Fiena Nelson	5	November 5, 2020	Im still downloading but i think it wil be fun

Galexie Banuelos	1	November 5, 2020	This game is stupid
Kellie Koehler	5	November 5, 2020	I love this app there are lots of adds but it does not bother me.
Happy Campet	3	November 5, 2020	The game is fun for awhile. You don't get many nail polish options and the accessories are basic. And when you watch a video to claim stuff, it's never in my inventory!
Michelle Trejo	3	November 5, 2020	This game is fun but it has a little bit longer ads and it is not that fun the game is good it is a little more stuff.😁😁😁

Hayden Norris	5	November 6, 2020	It's a really good game but 5he one thing I would like to change is the easyness of it it's a bit hard to drag the polish and that's it
Lianne Farmer	1	November 6, 2020	I love it stop saying *oh to much ads* there's not that many
Anahita Senemar	1	November 6, 2020	Very bad

Michelle Smeenge	5	November 6, 2020	Fun!
Rusty Spøøn_666	4	November 6, 2020	I got this app because I practice acrylic in real life, but I only rated it 4 stars because as fun as it is, I prefer real life and enjoy the challenge of shaping them myself. However, it is easier to shape the nails with the, I assume, plastic template that you use.
Tania Juarez	1	November 6, 2020	I just downloaded and right away an ad appeared i was doing a nail and another ad
Pamela Buford	1	November 6, 2020	Too many Ads

Missy Carson	3	November 6, 2020	I did enjoy the game however it was very slow and hard to maintain good control. Good graphics. Vibrated every time I would touch the screen which would drain my battery significantly (please fix).
J walker	2	November 6, 2020	I luv this game and wont stop so yes bye.
Brittany Bromfield	1	November 6, 2020	I don't know how this game has such a high score that anybody who is reviewing this game and giving it a high score is lying because every single 10 seconds there's an ad and there is never not an ad for every single thing and I believe in playing it for 5 minutes and every 2 seconds there's an ad no matter what I do no matter if I'm with a client it's an ad so all the to lie everybody who's a really miss is a liar I don't know how I have a 3.8 star review I really don't understand
Giovanna Dankyi	5	November 6, 2020	THIS IS SO FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Dawn Edwards	5	November 6, 2020	it's so cool!
Kena McBroom	1	November 6, 2020	To many ads and it glitches
_Itz Eve_	2	November 6, 2020	"I'm not a fan of this game. It had ads after each client and in the middle of me doing someone's nails. Painting the nails is super hard because the brush doesn't line up with your finger and it's really hard to control. It's an ""ok"" and simple game. But would not recommend."
Elaine Williams	5	November 6, 2020	It is so fun for kids who want to be a nail artist 😊❤🧡

Will not let me upgrade the room past levels 5 and 6 (dont know if that's the limit or a glitch). Not sure what all the money is for if I cant upgrade anything. Kinda boring after a day. And a lot of ads but not the most I've seen in a game.
Glenda Caballes Bukiron	2	November 6, 2020	Literally after.. I do the first nail it logs me out of the app instantly.. I try to do it over again i have the same result. But its a really nice game still. Please fix this bug! It might be my phone i or something but yea thank you!

asha gratton	1	November 6, 2020	Ads are annoying after every actions you do. Would be better if you change it so you watch an ad after you finish a level. I just installed this game less than 15 minutes and already uninstalling as the ads make it annoying, unplayable and boring.

Anika Burke	2	November 7, 2020	Sooo many adds and it was super glichy too. You have to watch so many adds for things. Don't get this game if u hate adds.
Parker Pierson	4	November 7, 2020	Love this game so much. I love the graphics it does kind of have lot of adds, but other than the adds I live this game so much I waste so much time playing this game.
Kirsty Barry	1	November 7, 2020	Too many adverts. I can do adverts for advancements and at the end of levels but this was 30 second ads for every 10 seconds of play. Just unbearable. Also the controls feel kind of clunky but didn't really get far enough to get to grips.
Hey I'm Trying	1	November 7, 2020	I kept trying to get past the tutorial but it kept crashing after I finished
aylah Castellanos	5	November 7, 2020	It is fun

Erica Smith	1	November 7, 2020	They give us a time for the nail to get the length of the nail
Carolyn Guzman Rios	5	November 7, 2020	Learning a new thing. How to give someone acrylic nails.
Becky Colon	1	November 7, 2020	Way too much lag in the game. Not worth it
Kaylee Hedrick	2	November 7, 2020	It's good and fun but theres this one ad where I can't skip. Speaking of ads theres too many of them.
Méi	4	November 7, 2020	"This app is lowkeyy addicting. Its really cool but the one thing I would change is that I would like the ""accessories"" to be more like the VIP ones."

Adriana Rey	5	November 7, 2020	It is a good game
Toasted Marshmallow	1	November 7, 2020	Awful. Get one nail done then it crashes and goes back to my phone's homescreen. If I reopen the app I do the exact same nail and then it crashes (repeat as many times as you want) tried force stopping it on my phone but that did about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. Deleted it and will never install again, just a waste of storage space 🙄

Serenity Fox	3	November 7, 2020	Game itself is decent the graphics are surprisingly nice but the ads yet again have ruined this game for me and it is a tad laggy. Yes I know the need for ads but these ads are ridiculous. They play after every level which isn't needed and have now started playing after every level and popping up during levels as well. Please fix the ad rate this game would be nice if ads played after every two or so levels and didn't pop up mid way through a level.
Skylah Golden	5	November 7, 2020	Fun game

StarlightCookie	5	November 7, 2020	I love this game!!! People are saying its bad and blah blah blah but it's great!

Kayla Lannen	3	November 7, 2020	It is cool but it has to many adds and it is to easy to play all I have to do it keep my fingers on the screens and it will do it from me.One thing I would like to change about the game is not that many ads and make it harder and more challenging from peple to play or peple will not wont to play.That is the reason I rated this game three,3 stars. Please fix it.

Gracie Hart	4	November 7, 2020	This game was OKAY , but there were a lot of adds . I only kept this game for a few minutes before uninstalling it , I wasn't very interested . I also didn't like how it always told you what to do , and it did it for you . Such as the nail filing part , it automatically told you when your done , other wise it was okay for a few minutes.

Kid Vicious	2	November 8, 2020	This could be an amazing opportunity for a very addictive game. Unfortunately to many ads. This should be a skill based game. With a mixture of timing and rhythm. I gave it a low rating because. It held my daughters and wife's attention for less the 5 minutes. Could be a great game. Keep working at it.
Aryanna Huff	5	November 8, 2020	I have always wanted a game like this and it kinda if teaches people who want to learn to do nails
Sean Nowak	1	November 8, 2020	What the actual fawk😃

Shray	5	November 8, 2020	So fun I love it
Elly izhere	2	November 8, 2020	Too many ads
michae gokey	1	November 8, 2020	It takes too long for the acrylic to be spread across the nail it should be easier than it is maybe make it so that the brush actually spreads it across the nail instead of wandering aimlessly if that makes sense kinda hard to explain it's just more difficult than it should be
Kila Jennings	2	November 8, 2020	Too easy. Boring
Jasmine Mcelhaney	2	November 8, 2020	Very glitchy
SaraAnn Gatewood	5	November 8, 2020	Bc it's very fun and interesting and inspiring

jessica morris	1	November 8, 2020	:-* it's streat out poop
Paige Whiting	5	November 8, 2020	Love this game
Ashley Walston	1	November 8, 2020	It could have been a great game but right in the middle of doing nails adds pop up too bad because it's not even worth playing now. I see adds at the end but right in the middle of the game is ridiculous.
Gracie Brown	3	November 8, 2020	I like it but too mini ads
Ruth Cavins	2	November 8, 2020	Honestly I'd play the game it's fun if not limited. The problem is the ads. It's like every time you change screens there's an ad. Like is it so hard to just put an option to buy an ad free version?
Charlie Allen-Rodriguez	5	November 8, 2020	Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i like it befor i dowlanded it
Sean Brooks	4	November 8, 2020	Cool
Reagan	3	November 8, 2020	Too many adds
Derriyonna Henry	4	November 8, 2020	It is glichy but it is a fun game
Lynn Macey	3	November 8, 2020	I would have played this game but as soon as I joined the game started to leg so I quit the app and rejoined but it was still lagging but it was probably just my device so I'm not trying to say the game is bad it just needs to be fixed with its legs.😊😌

Carolyn Paul	5	November 8, 2020	Can you do a hair game next?
Abigail Ferguson	1	November 8, 2020	Worst game ever
Laila Torres	2	November 8, 2020	The reason why I'm giving this game a two-star review let me tell you so as soon as I downloaded the game it was starting out very slow and laggy so I would like maybe it's just a glitch so I keep playing and I'm doing a client's nails and then after an ad pops up I don't like how as soon as I get a as soon as I get the games and add pops up I don't think that they should have that immediately I think that it should wait a few moments or after a few levels and then some actual pop up and they do
That_one_Slytherin _	1	November 8, 2020	It was pretty fun for the small amount of time I played, but it literally glitched my entire phone out. Like I couldn't even turn it off without it glitching.
Nancy Lane	1	November 8, 2020	It was so slow
Danielle Danley	1	November 8, 2020	Saw this as an add on Tik Tok. Hit install... Someone had lied to us all... There are a ToN of adds.
XxChoclate WeirdoxX	5	November 8, 2020	You guys do so many cool games! TYSM FOR GOOD GAMES FOR KIDS!
palwasha barekzai	2	November 8, 2020	I don't like it because when I pick a type of nial it always makes it this one that is not the one that I pick so thatt Is why I only picked 2 stars not a great game in my opinion.
Arielle Malaysia	4	November 8, 2020	Its cool it gives you a lot of ads

Shannon Ropella	1	November 8, 2020	Ads every 5 seconds
Katie Draws	2	November 8, 2020	I really dont mind the ads but what really made me put 2 stars is the fact that for me at least, when you finish the nails and you get the money, it saves to the camera roll. I looked everywhere and I found nothing to turn it off.
minegirl 0242	5	November 8, 2020	I love it and I really like it 😊❤️
Kara Corbin	2	November 8, 2020	lags on everything you do on this app and the nail accessories wont let me scroll thru to see more than the first 3 or 4 nail art designs the app offers. and i cant claim my tip rewards or double my rewards at the end of every nail session

Amal Odeh	4	November 8, 2020	It's a great game with so good details👍👍❤️❤️❤️
Kitkat Kion	4	November 8, 2020	Okay let me start off like this so when you join the game you have to follow what they're telling you to do at first after that you can basically decorate the nails and style it your own way but there is a few ads obviously it's that type of game what did you expect don't expect less from that type of game but it's fun really fun actually I had a lot of fun doing it and if you pick no thanks you're going to get an ad because it's that type of game 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Elena Morris	1	November 8, 2020	There were WAY TO MANY adds and the graphics could have been WAY better ಠ ೧ ಠ
Priyanshi	5	November 8, 2020	👍
NANDLAL PATEL	5	November 8, 2020	I like four your mother

Kashif Iqbal	4	November 8, 2020	This is a very good game in my choice..some people like it but there can also be some of the choices to make nails of people by ur own choice ..so i think this is the main point i want to discuss💕💕💕

Kim Anoff	2	November 8, 2020	Its ok, the adverts are what made me uninstall, you get an ad every minute or so. Gave up after 10 minutes
Jenna Hale	3	November 8, 2020	I liked the game, but whenever you do a nail it saves the pic in your gallary. And I don't like this, but if you do then this is a good game overall in my opinion.
Rowen Chetty	5	November 8, 2020	So my stile

LuCy LiKes StRaWbErRy CoWs	1	November 8, 2020	"A LOT of adverts it's soo laggy and not really much to do it doesn't give any colors that match unless ur on a high level and it keeps telling me to ""claim x2"" and I know that's not even a bad thing but it's close to the skip button which I sometimes press the claim 2 and it doesn't let me off the advert so I have to watch it. Other than that this game is ok I guess bc I love nails and I like wearing them but this game is just not really it for me."

Zo Squad	4	November 8, 2020	I LOVE THIS GAME BUT!I don't like when it's laggy I love it but PLEASE fix it I get so mad that I just wanna delete it but please fix it I won't be mad
MacKenzie Hayward	1	November 8, 2020	If you download this get ready for a ton of adds its fun and all but there is an ad every two seconds! I downloaded it and right away I got an add. Don't download this it is a waste of time.
Eager Positivity	2	November 8, 2020	I wish that there could be LESS ADS. I dont mind ads usually but I cant buy the no ads. Every time I click something there is an ad. Also i wish that there were more designs and stencils and no matter what color you used there would be the same nail polish colors. The last thing i wish is that there was an option to do each nail different or all of them the same.
Punaam Rai	5	November 8, 2020	It so fun i like it

Koriander Yander	3	November 9, 2020	Excessive advertisements is a sure fire way to make people Uninstall even the most enjoyable games. The game is good. I got an ad after finishing the first hand, another ad in the middle of the second hand, then another advertisement at the end of the third hand. Excessive advertisements kill your app, and actually make you lose money, because people will Uninstall it. UPDATE: Got another ad immediately after placing the bead on the 4th hand. The game is fun, but Ive Uninstalled it.

Autumn Hayes	1	November 9, 2020	Horrible. Too many ads. It will not let me watch videos to claim my tips. Will not let me watch the videos to get the other nails, drills, or stickers. The graphics are okay and it's hard to control the brush. It tells you to make a symbol to use the drill but that does not work.

Birendra Lal Modi	1	November 9, 2020	Good but this game store the picture in gallery. 😑😑
Jerilyn Wilson	3	November 9, 2020	Why I put a 3 star is because of when you are done with the nails it screen shots it and then there are a bunch of nails that you painted and then messes up your phone are iPad and it is just not right for me. And I think there are to many adds and that is what I hate about games like this.
Magen Condren	3	November 9, 2020	Overall the game is pretty fun but I gave it three stars because when you hit stiletto or any other type of nail shape it doesn't actually do that nail shape it makes you fall down one side to a weird curved edge and it doesn't look like a stiletto tip or whichever tip you picked and so I gave it three stars because it doesn't do what you ask so that's kind of like a big deal

Benaiza Patell	5	November 10, 2020	This app is a very entertaining app as it allows you to make different nail designs etc.This app is amazing for kids and teens its a completely appropriate game so I suggest you all to download it.😍❤️ But I would give one suggestion to the app changes I would like the maker of the app make the player actually fully paint the acrylic nails bc sometimes when ur finished on half of the nail the game makes the hole thing completed/coloured But rest from that this game is amazing
Vashnavi Goel	1	November 10, 2020	IDK
Ailey Zadoian	5	November 10, 2020	I LOVE THIS GAME. This game is really fun and cool. I really enjoy this game. I love to play it. When I have the time I will play this game. But whenever you win or get everything it gets boring because you used everything already. This game needs more nails more colors and more designs. But over all I really recommend this game.
Neda Alaie	5	November 10, 2020	🤩🤩🤩🤩😘
Irene Playz	2	November 10, 2020	It's a fun game and yes there are a bunch of ads but it's a free app game. The only thing I have to complain about is that after every hand when you're done and it does the picture thing where it rates it it actually saves the picture to your camera without asking, after a few minutes of playing I went into my camera and saw all the nails I had made! It's a good game but please make it so that we have a choice on whether it is saved into our camera or not.
Victoria Green	1	November 10, 2020	To many ads

Shilpa Kapoor	5	November 12, 2020	This is very good game 👌😍
Skye titley	1	November 12, 2020	I didn't give my permission for the game to save the nail photos on my actual phone gallery! If the game is able to do that what else is it doing? Way to many adverts to even enjoy the game properly! In the space of one client I had 3 adverts then another 2 after I done the nails so it is rather had to enjoy after getting interrupted by adverts! Graphics is great. But unfortunately due to the above I'm having to uninstall the game as I can't enjoy.

Heather Burley	5	November 13, 2020	Reeeeeeeeeee
Nidhi Kashyap	1	November 13, 2020	This game is fun but it has many problems. 1. The game is slow 2. It saves a picture on your device without telling/ asking to save. 3. It's game play is not nice. I like that it is 3D and it's graphics are nice. There are not many adds
Shalini Atwal	5	November 13, 2020	Nice and awesome game

Kaitlyn Dorer	1	November 13, 2020	This game has so many ads and it is super slow and glitchy i would totally 10/10 not recommend this game and i know its not because of my phone because before I got this it was perfectly fine!!!😡😡
Anna Whitehead	5	November 13, 2020	Great app. Strangely addictive and very smooth graphics. Only one slight problem is that I completed the game in like 3 days so I can only do the same things over and over again.
Ty Nation	2	November 13, 2020	It lags to much i just downloaded this game and it lags so much
مرضیه پناهلو	5	November 13, 2020	عالی بود حتما نصبش کنید واقعا دست سازندش درد نکنه😘😘😘
alani mallory	3	November 13, 2020	TOO MANY ADS but a good game.
Murmaider1823	1	November 13, 2020	It looks like my previous review got removed. Not sure why. I certainly didn't do it. Very suspicious. Makes it look like the developers are trying to hide something. It's a fun game, but I wish there were more options for customization. Also I found out that this app is able to add photos to your camera roll without permission. Which makes me wonder what else they have access to without asking for permission. Like I said before, makes me uneasy about reinstalling this app. Downloader beware.
Jazzlyn Selda	1	November 13, 2020	So laggy 😠😠😠😠( 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎

Sloth_Queen 4_Life	5	November 13, 2020	I think this game is really really good! I don't find the ads a problem and there isn't even that much! It's super fun and relaxing! One things is I accidently clicked something and because there was lag I couldn't change it. I hope this will help you improve this game!!
logan heath	2	November 13, 2020	the amount of ads overshadow any enjoyment produced by this game.

Amanda Oneill	1	November 13, 2020	Really glitchy and lots of adds
Nariah Welch	5	November 13, 2020	This game is cool but to many ads🤩
Coffee Cake	1	November 13, 2020	I would have given it a five star but I put it to a bad one star because I have a huge problem with this app....they literally save the nails you did on your phone they shouldn't and it didn't ask permission to do this it's terrible and never ever ever download this app onto your phone as a result this fills up your storage and you'll have to delete every month or so and don't download it onto your phone no matter what
UAT Ruddock	3	November 13, 2020	It is a good app but u can not customize as much for my self I would prefer custom app over them doing it for u

Jasper Kai	2	November 13, 2020	I understand having ads on a free game but there's so many it makes it unplayable. You'll spend more time watching ads than playing the game.

Skye The Shy	1	November 13, 2020	Dont install, it ignores any permissions you deny. I denied it everything but it somehow still managed to save pictures to my storage.

Seven McCloud	1	November 13, 2020	I give it a one because I tried it on my sister's phone and it was boring
Laxmi Langwa	1	November 13, 2020	This game I thought was nice. Well i read the reviews and thought why not dowload it. But as soon as i installed and clicked on it my phone started glitching and it really scared me. I was finally able to delete it but dowloaders beware.
Amber Poe	2	November 13, 2020	This game would be waaaayyy better if there weren't alot of adds
Sinchana A R	5	November 13, 2020	Nice and enjoying game
lucy Parkinson	3	November 13, 2020	A good game but I don't understand why it automatically saved every picture to my phone and why there are so many adverts throughout a couple of minutes game play?
Nicole Andrea Reyes	5	November 13, 2020	It is great and super realistic
Dope Chick	1	November 13, 2020	Very bad game if it had a zero rating o would give it
FYFE DAWG	1	November 13, 2020	More ads than game play. I wonder how many people keep playing games like this , must be a lot because these developers keep doing it. Otherwise could have been nice casual creative outlet.
Mohd Shameer	5	November 13, 2020	Super but no more options
Mochi Molala	4	November 13, 2020	It's a pretty good game the only thing is that it is necessary for my phone to hang with games and this is the 3rd time this game hanged my phone and I accused that because it never really happen to my games I recently downloaded
Dipali Choudhury	1	November 13, 2020	I hate it the shapes are much worst than the photo

Aphelele Ndamane	2	November 13, 2020	If I'm being honest, it's quite a fun game but I only downloaded it today and I had to uninstall it thirty minutes later cause it had a glitch, it wouldn't play and truly I don't recommend this game, the graphics are top notch though.
wolfless	5	November 13, 2020	i love this game people say it has way too many ads and its the worst. they are just jelous of it. i would recommed you install it its very fun
Ahmed Nadeem	5	November 13, 2020	I like it's game
Manaal Moosa	1	November 13, 2020	It was entertaining.... at first. Then I started accumulating coins with nothing to buy cos I've bought everything and I have nothing to unlock cos I've unlocked everything and there is nothing to look forward to anymore. Also it saves the finished nails to my camera roll without even asking for my permission to access it. Suspicious.
CHANDRAKALA BAI latha shree	1	November 13, 2020	Dont give more ads i am very very angry 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
Camille Tapererwa	4	November 13, 2020	The colours of the skin tones are off like on the white people that arrive the colour of their hands are so red like it distracts and clashes with the nails. So please fix this.
Tajinder Kaur	3	November 13, 2020	Hi all actually i love this game but there are many ads that is disturbing to me i off the wifi but ads are not stoping soo plzzzzzzzzzz i request that plz fix this problem......

sachin malik	5	November 13, 2020	Very very nice game
Alexis Dauley	2	November 13, 2020	Honestly, I thought this game was really fun! However, the excessive amount of ads killed it for me. Ads show up at the end of almost every round and sometimes pop up while you're in the middle of something. Usually, if there are too many ads, I immediately uninstall the game, and I know that I'm not the only person who thinks this. I gave an extra star because I did enjoy the game, but the ads made it not worth playing

Maria Ulfa	5	November 14, 2020	Great
Rachel Likes Gacha life	1	November 14, 2020	This is bad. First level, barely can even cover the whole nail, it's so laggy! Once I finally covered the nail, I'm hit with an ad. Please make it less laggy.
Valerie Adaba	5	November 14, 2020	I LOVE IT. IT IS SO SATISFYING AND FUN.I PRETEND IM IN A NAIL SHOP AND I DO AMAZING NAILS,THANKS FOR MAKING THIS GAME
Sylvia Hardin	2	November 14, 2020	Every time I try to use the stencils I get the fire flames and it don't let me use it it says I have to pay for it but on my iPad I can use it but it's just a messed up game

Habiba Rashid	5	November 14, 2020	It's the best game for a girl but a little boring but still pretty nice
An Apprentice For Life	1	November 14, 2020	Fun game, but not many options, and it's too automated. I'm giving it 1 star because of the ADS. Absolutely ridiculous amount of ads. I couldn't even get through ONE client without at least 2 ads. Uninstalled. Will not recommend this game to anyone unless the ads are fixed. Sad when the developers care more about money than the actual game. You'd make more if you actually had a decent game, less ads, and more purchase options. Wish I could give negative stars.
Pixie 1 Finn	2	November 14, 2020	I didn't like it I thought it would be a fun salon game but its not i am unistalling pretty boring 😴

M P	1	November 14, 2020	@CrazyLabs If you want to make money through a game, make a good game. Don't delete reviews giving you constructive criticism on what to improve to then replace them with obvious bots. Just make the game better. It has too many ads and the gameplay is boring. I want more ability to mess up. Without it, the game gets repetitive very quickly. The graphics are ok, though.
Lachondra Steele	5	November 14, 2020	the best game and I love how u do the niles with that niall thing
Laurel Scammell	1	November 14, 2020	"Honestly boring. I like how you ""make the acrylics"" 👍🏻 I like how we pick colour 👍🏻 but we can't choose how long it goes 👎 there's lots of ads👎 it's boring in general 👎 and when I opened it, it crashes straight away 👎"
George Manrique	5	November 14, 2020	I like this game It is the best
Brooklyn Hazel	4	November 14, 2020	The game is really fun! It becomes addictive for sure! The only thing that I don't like about the app is the overwhelming amount of ads that pop up randomly for no reason. But other than app it's a great app! Control are good, graphics are great, and the gameplay is smooth! Wouldn't mind more nail colors and control of where you but the jewelry or stencils. Other than that, awesome game! Highly recommend it!
Crystal Clear	3	November 14, 2020	okay game but no need for that many ads.

Amiya Pettway	3	November 14, 2020	"It was fun at first then it got a little boring and it will give you not a lot lot but it will give you a ""lot"" of ads."
Abby Fudge	3	November 14, 2020	Pros: it's definitely a good game, buuut there can be some flaws to that. Cons: It's laggy sometimes and it makes it's very own folder in Google photos if you have it. Also immediately uninstalled it when I figured out had access to my camera roll! 😳😳😳
Lillie Westmoreland	5	November 14, 2020	It is so fun😁

ALW	3	November 14, 2020	Too many ads.
Cecilia Castilho	1	November 14, 2020	This app was terrible. I got the app on my iPad and decided to get it also on my phone. It would not download and took forever, I even downloaded other apps faster then this one. Even after it finished downloading it was very laggy and wouldn't let me in. it would just be a black screen and then it would log me off the app. one of my worst experiences
Stealthyped	4	November 14, 2020	The game can be a buggy at times but it is still fun to the play. The ads arent as bad as people are making them sound.
Santa Devi	5	November 14, 2020	Good 👍🏻❤️
Chili Pepper	1	November 14, 2020	To many ads. I mean way to many ads. After one step you get a long ad. And graphics are no it.
עינת ויטנר	5	November 14, 2020	Just feel like it's really good and I feel like I should get my nails done like that because that that that was just that amazing game I just played and it was amazing and I just loved it thank you for making it by

Ashley Guldan	1	November 14, 2020	Too many ads ruin it! This could be a very relaxing and satisfying game but ads every 20 seconds make it stressful!!! Uninstalling now!
Daniel Yaqoob	1	November 14, 2020	After watching add I love to play this game but after installing it's hanging hanging and hanging and I'll never played this game properly... That's why I remove it from my mob.

Bharadwaj Giridhar	4	November 2, 2020	Haha funny and nice game. Found a bug where if you hit the finish line first with less wooden plates and run around your way back to the track you can infinitely collect more plates and get 15x points each time. Nice 2 days with this app. Got pretty addictive. Uninstalling. Good work dev! Wish it had multiplayer!

Just another Hank Hill Account	1	November 3, 2020	Ad aftet ad, even if I choose not to watch one Just honestly, stop making these games. It's obvious no effort is put into these as your ads for these pollute YouTube ads. If you're gonna make a game, don't be lazy about it
The Hebsquatch	1	November 3, 2020	STOP MAKING GAMES VOODOO! They all mainly suck now because you killed your OWN CONTENT THE GAME WITH ENDLESS ADS! Seriously knock it off with this. No reason there needs to be a 30 to 1:30 min add at the end of every level. It's no wonder you guys are losing SO MUCH RESPECT on Mobile gaming.
forest tire	1	November 3, 2020	The only purpose of this game is to make money off ads, DON'T DOWNLOAD

Shlok Sharma	5	November 3, 2020	I like the game 👍
Lionel Vargas	1	November 3, 2020	I know people have to make their living but come on, there are games that do better without or few ads. Bots are the only thing you play against in this game and it so frustratingly easy. This type of game should be online. The game itself is pretty fun till you get hit by the ads though. Its not only this game but to all voodoo created games. Please Fix.😡
Sejan Thapa	5	November 3, 2020	It's correct 😊😊 game for me
Sanyogita Tripathi	5	November 3, 2020	Good

Geophysics Lover	3	November 3, 2020	build your way and jump to the edges but one thing that there's ads so turn airplane mode on so its kinda fun but the rest is just good and stuff but there's no online but you need the mod menu for installing online thats the fun part! have a good time!
Daniel	1	November 3, 2020	The forced ads last longer than the fake multiplayer races (turn on airplane mode and mysteriously race against other players...). Not worth anyone's time. Tried voodoo again, this reinforces that they are the worst when it comes to monetizing with excessive ads.
ganchalife with hiya	1	November 3, 2020	It is the worst game ever! If u want me to rate then make it soomoth it hangs when u are running but for now i am rating one star because my friend like this game 😠

Bong dila	4	November 3, 2020	😍😍😍😍😍
Matthew Borg	1	November 3, 2020	Kind of fun. But you have to watch ads even if you don't want the bonus after every level. I would rather just pay $3-5 for a full game with no ads.
Christopher Van Ochten	1	November 3, 2020	UNPLAYABLE, UNLESS YOU LIKE NON STOP ADS, DONT PLAY THIS GAME.

Jason Brugger	1	November 4, 2020	Obviously it's absolutely terrible, shouldn't even need to read the reviews to see that, but I installed and played this just so I could give it 1 star for having the most annoying advertisement I have ever seen in my entire life. If I were your boss and you showed me that ad for approval, I would have fired you on the spot. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Eric Ladner	2	November 5, 2020	Just installed. Played about eight or ten rounds. Now I'm uninstalling. I really don't mind ads for free apps. But I can't stand apps that require a 30-second between each round that each lasts less time than that.
سعید رضایی	5	November 5, 2020	THIS GAME IS AWESOME. But it's to glitchy and makes me fall

Renzi Vega	1	November 5, 2020	Please save yourself from this horrible experience! It's not even online it's just bots doing the exact same thing and the game lags when you are not online and you get to break all laws of physics and gravity by walking on a floating bridge as you build it. Please don't download this game I legit have a headache after playing it.
mandy gonzalez	1	November 5, 2020	Delete this app now thanks
Kamaya yarbrough	4	November 5, 2020	This game is brilliant
Donovan Knott	1	November 5, 2020	Just like every other game these guys make. Great idea, but ads just make it and awful experience. Bots are pretty bad too and online would make this game a massive hit, but still, ads ruin the game.
Al Desouza	4	November 5, 2020	If you don't mind an advertisement after every single race....then this is a great game.
Destiny Contreras	4	November 5, 2020	A good time consumer
Daniel B	1	November 5, 2020	Ad every level, I thought I'd try it because it looked simple and fun. It is, but everyone is right there is an ad every level! You might as well just click the watch video for the extra coins. Not worth the frustration being that each level is typically shorter than the ads themselves. Do an ad every 3 or 4 levels.
Jazmine Rojas	5	November 5, 2020	This game is amazing! I don't get why everyone is giving this game 1 stars for stupid reasons. Unlike other games, this game has a few ads but I don't get unpaitence like others. Love how you added skins and a bunch of levels so It doesn't have to repeat. Love this game!!
MMA GAMING	1	November 5, 2020	Inappropriate ads playing
Dejhi Collick	1	November 5, 2020	The game is freaking trash that ads are longer than the freaking levels that that's that's just bad and the thing is the game isn't Fun short if it was a little longer I'll give it like a 3 I I just don't like the game

Bryan Spruill	1	November 5, 2020	10 sec levels a baby could beat against super easy bots, followed by a 30 sec ad. Rinse, repeat, and then promptly uninstall

Jonathan Petrinitz	2	November 5, 2020	Gameplay is meh, you're not actually playing against other people, rather you're playing AIs made to look like other people. The difficulty is extremely low.
Goosy S	5	November 5, 2020	I feel bad for all your bad ratings but I love all your games and everything this game is amazing and I just got it today😂😀
john gold	1	November 5, 2020	This game made me angry i only had a 30 second timer ughh
Raven Hurte	3	November 5, 2020	It's a fun game with an enjoyable concept, but it lags.
Daniel Schade	4	November 5, 2020	A game that doesn't have a lot to 8t but fun nonetheless. Needs more content to be a 5 star game
YSAS	1	November 5, 2020	I play the game with internet connection turned off in the event that ads lag the game. Regardless the game lagged more than hell!! Not to mention the movement is super delayed! This doesn't even compare to the crazy rubberbanding of the computers! I've played some pretty terrible games from ads. The main differnece is that some ads looked and a disaster and do play. This game looked decent in comparison so I expected it to be alright, but it's an absolute dumpster fire.
Noah Burno	1	November 5, 2020	"Do you like ads? Do you hate actually playing games? This ad generator, erm... I mean ""game"" is for you!"

Apollo the Alian	1	November 5, 2020	Not good. I would rather play trap bubble bunny on repeat for the rest of my life then play one more second so last go into detail on way this is SO BAD. Was the art made from a first grader? Really I don't even know about 3d molting but I could still make something better. Next the maps are HORRIBLE it's the same thing but reskined. There is a ad for every other breath you take and there is NOTHING that says we DON'T care about the game only the money then well... THE WHOLE GAME.
venkanna Bathini	5	November 5, 2020	Nice game
xboxgame plays	4	November 5, 2020	The game overall is good it just needs to fix the lag. But besides that it's really fun to play.

Vladimir Radic	1	November 5, 2020	You run for 10sec, then watch ads for 5-30sec I tought that ads will go away after several times, but no. There is more ads, then actuall game. Deleted instantly
Ian k	1	November 5, 2020	First time reviewing a game. This game gives 30 second ads after EVERYTHING, you spend more time in ads then playing. Don't support this business model. Zero stars mane.

Sasquatch	2	November 5, 2020	2 stars. It would get an additional star if the lazy ass developer added sound to the game, and another for less ads.
Hope	1	November 5, 2020	You have barely any control over the character it just goes where it wants to half of the time and it's glitchy. I haven't played it for long so I don't know about the ad situation but I would guess that theres many. If u want people to play it then fix it cause its horrible!!!

Clancy Clawson	4	November 6, 2020	I admit it feels like those cheap games with as little effort as possible, and I'm subtly creeped out by the silence, but I have to give it to them, this one's actually unique. Premise is simple, yet actually challenging in a way I'd like to see polished by someone more capable. Control is slightly rough, perhaps if turning was based on where you touch, instead of based on the gesture you make, it would be smoother, devs. It has the common issue of too many ads but that's par for this dev.

mo hus	1	November 6, 2020	Uninstalled after playing it the first time. Horrible controls. Voodoo If you're gonna post annoying and long ads. Make sure they atleast work and are not buggy. Games by you guys feel like shopping at Dollar tree.
Roberto Alvarez	1	November 6, 2020	There is an ad after every level you pass. It give you an option to watch an ad or just collect your gold without a multiplier. But makes you watch an ad anyways.
Amir Dezfoulian	5	November 6, 2020	Good fun...not much to say about it
Grace Dudman-West	2	November 6, 2020	Am I the only one who thinks the controls are bad. There are way too many ads and bad graphics. I know this review is very short but I just wanted to tell you a bit about my small experience.

Steve Lipovich	1	November 6, 2020	Trash game. Not only ad galore, it also is very laggy
Original Tomkat	1	November 6, 2020	Has great potential. However, a 15+ second AD after EVERY less than 10 second LEVEL is a bit much. More time WATCHING ADS than playing the game.
KRISHNA CHAHAR	1	November 6, 2020	Game is Nice But It will slow down your phone like hell.. Also it is laggy... So 1 *

Zachary Allgood	1	November 6, 2020	These are one of the those crappy games where every time you finish the game you have to watch a 30 second ad or a 15-second ad and you cannot skip. All of that makes the game not fun because the game is over in less than 30 seconds sitting here to watch a 30-second ad.

Norman Walsh	1	November 6, 2020	Played two round coming in first place both times got hit with advertising that said 30 seconds but was clearly longer. They I went back to Google Play noticed developer Voodoo known better as TOXIC company. This studio over does advertising in every game sucking the fun out of games they develop. Ignorant developers don't listen as it's clear they are greedy.

Alexander Hoppie	2	November 7, 2020	Gameplay is smooth, needs work on the being able to customize your character. Last but not least, when finishing a run and are given the option for x3 rewards by watching an AD with no skips until its done, does NOT actually triple your earnings from the said run. I was at 28.3k and tripled 4.5k, when I should have been at 41.8k I was at 31.8k

Lucas Steer	2	November 8, 2020	Unlocks can be achieved quite quickly, leading to low playtime. Seems to be trying to fake online play? Ads make the phone run very hot and drain battery. Interesting mechanic, but just doesn't have enough to it to keep playing.
Michelle Dierker	1	November 8, 2020	It is so annoying because when you get on it don't turn itself you have to turn it and I'm like used to it to be like it tunes it's selfthat so that is why I gave it a one star also go check out the game stare run it's way better and rilly fun😍
Jess Squire	5	November 8, 2020	Good game to play

Sharon Townsend	4	November 8, 2020	It is an awsome game! If you don't read the reviews first, you wouldn't know that you are supposed to go to the finish line, and you just wonder around! It is sooo slow running. Those are the only bad things. If they improve them, then it will be the best game ever! It is really hard to turn.
Nadia Hassani	1	November 8, 2020	Nnnn

Main Account	1	November 8, 2020	This is an okay game, I turn on airplane mode and there is no ads. But when I make an big shortcut, like 25, it's too laggy for me to turn in time on the wavy track and I lose😭

Klynxi	2	November 8, 2020	Horrible gameplay is really laggy hard to control and ads
Bridget Emmerson	1	November 8, 2020	Possibly the most frustrating game I have ever played. If I swipe a tiny bit left, I end up in the sea. If I try to take a stack of blocks, I end up in the sea. If I do nothing, I somehow end up in the sea. This game has potential, sure, but the controls are TERRIBLE. I don't care about the adds, the controls are by far the worst thing in this game
Amy_the Bacon_head	1	November 8, 2020	I deleted all my apps for a stupid game oh wow!

Xx ThAnOs2oo4 xX	5	November 9, 2020	Nice
Mark Torselli	1	November 9, 2020	10 second level -> unskippable 30+ second ad. Every. Single. Level. You spend no time playing the game and way too much watching ads. Plus the levels are all exactly the same and against bots, not people
Lori Stevenson	5	November 9, 2020	Game looks so fun
Ava Boom	5	November 9, 2020	I love it
Suraya Sofea Evan	5	November 9, 2020	fun
tazegamer05	1	November 9, 2020	Well just like all the other games made by voodoo, they cant keep vert count low or code properly making the game way to choppy to even play smoothly
Holl S-B	2	November 9, 2020	Unrepresentative and boring . The skins are mainly white males, clear lack of equal representation as there is only a few female skins and people of colour are near to none. Furthermore the game lacks skins in general. I have collected all the skins and I only played it a bit over the last 2 or 3 days. This also now renders the coin system useless.
Ericberto Lopez	1	November 9, 2020	Way to many adds and not real players
Alamin Biswas	5	November 9, 2020	Good
Sophie McDonald	3	November 9, 2020	It's a very easy and short game but it's still good and it's a bit boring and I hate it because theres so many adds

Amirhossein Molarodi	5	November 9, 2020	Nice
victory vday	1	November 9, 2020	As with almost every single game I've tried from this company oversimplified and full of ads. That pairs with bots that are very easy to beat. The game is over in about 20 seconds. Same track over and over and over again every 20 seconds. In terms of a game, it's a cash grab.
Frost Gazy	1	November 9, 2020	This game haz like 3 fps I cant play it
Brett Christiana	4	November 9, 2020	Really good game but your playing with bots
Maria Aguinga	2	November 9, 2020	Not bad but ads 😐 they should really work on that and the character thing is pretty bad over all I only had fun for 2 mins playing this game 😐
Mortm	1	November 9, 2020	AD farm. Bad controls, ADs are unskippable, poor gameplay.
Yancy Angeles	1	November 9, 2020	Ad central
Aiden Milden	2	November 9, 2020	"Gameplay is kinda wonky, an ad plays after every single game played (each lasting roughly 30 seconds). There is also no online play, despite there being other named ""players"" with flags by their names, etc. The game itself is a neat idea, but comes off as more of a cash grab through spam ads and does not seem like much thought or effort was put into development. Thus, 2 stars is all I can give."
Sebastian S	1	November 9, 2020	It sucks
Sammy Telmani	4	November 9, 2020	It's a good game it's fun and no lagging soo that's good
P Purokayastha	1	November 9, 2020	Seriously why does there have to be ads if no ads it would be very helpful
Yousef Poornick	5	November 9, 2020	عالی بود
Kitty Coder	1	November 9, 2020	Get all the skins, games basically pointless. Would be more fun if there was a real people multiplayer, but we all know that cashgrab games never update or do anything about bugs or complaints. Don't waste your time, find a game with less ads and play that.
sebastian Gallegos	5	November 9, 2020	I have fun playing the game
RJ Weberg	1	November 9, 2020	Lagy thats all i have to say trash game tho

Josue Alcala	1	November 9, 2020	Full of ads, only bots
claire bear	5	November 9, 2020	This is a casual game for this brand.this is kinda a racing game.
Beverly Jackson	4	November 9, 2020	An ad after every run so you might as well triple your gold for the ad. Kinda glitchy sometimes but the game is good. Lots of characters to unlock and chose from, super easy.

Caleb Kraker	1	November 9, 2020	Voodoo is literally the worst. Every one of their games is unplayably laggy. That's 100%. It's unbearable. Every once in a great while I try another one out and I'm reminded why I left long ago as my blood pressure rises because of the awful game I just wasted my time in.
Joseph Barajas	1	November 9, 2020	Boohoo
OFFICIAL SHARK BOYZ	1	November 9, 2020	It's terrible
Symone Amore Makeup	2	November 9, 2020	Like there is no way im going to get threw this without an ad. Like every second i get on the gqme a ad comes up. Now if you see this and the other comments on this game then you should fix it forreal. GET THOSE DUM ADS OUT NOW IM NOT DOQNLOADING A GAME FROM A STUPID AD SO PLEASE FIX THIS!
Taylor Jones	5	November 9, 2020	I think it's very appropriate and very interesting to play and I just love it

greg loos	1	November 9, 2020	To simple to win. No end goal for rewards. In game money is not used for anything other then looks. Not playing agenst real people. Easy win: run to the end do not worry about having alot of bricks. Once you win you can backtrack to get all the bricks you want/need to hit higest point value.

Michael Pearson	1	November 9, 2020	I get you have ads but after the very first round and after declining the extra coins? It is a cool game but too greedy to watch a 30s ad after every game. You are a loser.

Schramm The Ram	4	November 9, 2020	This game is easy to play and addictive. You have something special here. You can really get creative with the map design. Add more skins, a leader board system, a menu to track your wins/losses(etc), and achievements to earn.

cookie Amira	4	November 10, 2020	OK O _O you might be looking at me why I gave this 4 stars is because it's a really fun game and all you got to do is just turn off your internet to not get ads but there's a little glitch in the game so that's why I gave it four stars but it has really good quality and it's a good game I'm not saying it's bad it's good

Jordan Barth	1	November 10, 2020	The game is insanely glitchy and you can barely move withoit the game clipping you into the ocean. If they actually did some maintenance on this game, it would be extremely entertaining. Right now its just a mess that makes it impossible to navigate

Fong Vang	3	November 10, 2020	Cool concept but boring because the other players are just AIs/bots. Play with airplane mode on to bypass ads. Would rate a 5 if you can actually play with other online players in real time.
Ice shooting Star	1	November 10, 2020	The controls are terrible if I turn the slightest bit I fall
Marvia Quarshie	4	November 10, 2020	I like the game but when I opened it a few days ago it did not have the regular thing that shows up a.k.a the picture of your character but when I opened it it had a picture of the sea and you having 100 coins when I had a million and when I deleted it and install it again when my phone died and I charged it and turned on my phone it had the pic of the sea I suggest you do something about this immediately for the love of God fix it this is not a mother talking it's a conserd 10 year old

Ian Kasner	2	November 10, 2020	Why do I keep installing VOODOO games, they're all cash grabs with such interesting ideas but the poorest of greedy executions that could be fun if they put effort into them but they dont. Game is obviously full of bots, they hardly even try to hide it, levels are painfully short and just on a whole other level of easy, dont even waste your time with yet another trashy ad ridden cash grab from your buddy ol' pals at VOODOO. Also, please at least change your style of design it's always the same.

Mitch	2	November 11, 2020	Uninstalled almost immediately after one game, due to lag and the low level of controls. It makes the game so hard to complete. All though the animations look hard worked that's made an extra star. But then we have the ads which are like 30 seconds and you can finish a level in about 20 seconds. And it has an ad every time you lose OR win. So that's made another star lost.

Samuel Elder	1	November 12, 2020	It's not very challenging. No PvP in the real world. Hilariously easy. I wouldnt reccomend. Maybe I would download this for my 2 year old, but with as many ads that pop up it wouldn't be worth the risk. I'm sure that's the point of this game is for the ads. Probably how they are making a profit on this game.

Daniel Kdeez	3	November 12, 2020	It seems to glitch when trying to turn, not sure if it's my phone or the game
asdfg hjkl	1	November 12, 2020	All Bots. All voodoo games have similar concepts. Over 0/5
Alexander Nock	1	November 12, 2020	Decent idea, but the lag makes it unplayable. If the graphics responded to your movements, it'd be a 4/5.

Xxdemonslasher x	2	November 12, 2020	This was fun for about 5 minutes then became so repetitive. There is nothing other then skins too work for and after each level there is an ad. Not even worth the time too download

Thay Dyano	1	November 12, 2020	Too much annoying ads
Amanda Childs	3	November 12, 2020	It could be a fun little time waster, however the levels are short and ended by an ad with every level. More so if you want the bonuses. Could be better if you didn't spend the same amount of time playing as you do waiting for ads.
kal hazamy	4	November 12, 2020	So far so good
Lindsey Ghorbani	3	November 12, 2020	This is a fun game, but I always start out in last place. And let me tell you I do NOT like it. It is a fun game ya, but I would love it to change.

Also was this supposed to be multiplayer fairly certain it's not crappy ai opponents and such pretty hard to lose a round rather be able to run against thinking players that actually put up a challenge. Tho it was fun to clear out all of the opponents before I made it to the finish line. Why is this top free currently?

Dildo Swaggins	1	November 13, 2020	"The only thing challenging about this game is its laggy controls. You can't turn unless you anticipate where you want to be in the next 5 seconds because the delay is horrible. It's not my phone, and the ads make it lag worse. This company just makes bad games with good concepts. Like ""if"" it worked, ""if"" they didn't cram ads into every sphincter of the game, ""if"" they actually cared.. this would be a good game. But they dont. Voodoo is trash and needs to fall into bankruptcy."

Mr Victim	5	November 14, 2020	خیلی با مزه است
ellemen opie	3	November 14, 2020	Pretty fun until there's an ad after every single run! And to top it off, it freezes and crashes after every ad!
Noureen Amber	1	November 14, 2020	Seriously hate it. Its toooooo laggy thats why i alwaya lose. Like whenever they start the game i always stay at the back. And the person at the first wins. Like this is not fair at all. And the viberation is irritating. A game should be fun not frustaing. Dont install this app just a waste of space, internet and time.
Eleanor	2	November 14, 2020	Okay concept but quite slow and obviously not very well funded - you can tell but the quality and the number of ads
BLUE 141	5	November 14, 2020	Yyyyy
Avery Techaira	5	November 14, 2020	Verry good
Junis Mohammed	3	November 14, 2020	It's a really fun game though it's a bit low quality. And the game look lazy. Voodo you should put a little more time in this game, Other than that the game is really fun!

Alyessa King	3	November 14, 2020	It cuts out A LOT and turns when I am trying to go straight and sometimes it turns the opposite direction that I'm trying to go to so I am going to delete it so I would not download it if you are trying to.
Chris Quinn	1	November 14, 2020	I hate it
Chad Trimle	5	November 14, 2020	Cool idea base apron some else idea
Jesse Roman	5	November 14, 2020	It is really fun and you go to the finished line really fast And sometimes you win
James Bednarik	1	November 14, 2020	Games entertaining but ads everywhere! I enjoyed the game at first but I have now found out that at the end of a match you have the option to continue or watch an ad for 3x the coins... If you choose to not watch the ad and just continue you still get a 30 second ad... Your better off taking the extra coins since you have to watch it anyway. would be a regular game of mine if the development team wasn't so greedy and just made use want to get the extra coins for skins or to unlock a course
Gbenga Dairo	5	November 14, 2020	It was fine and the race are good
Eric	1	November 14, 2020	Too many ads. No sound.
Phyo Nyi Htwe	3	November 14, 2020	Good
L. Perego	1	November 14, 2020	10 sec or less of playing for 30 sec Ad, you always start last, and always against BOTs.

Laura Thompson	1	November 14, 2020	This game is not good. Its unique but that is the only good thing. Your person moves far to fast. Its lagy and you always start at the back. I think this game is bad. Do not downlode it. Its a waste of time😠😠😠😤😤😤
Back To 80's	3	November 14, 2020	Stop it with the ads. It gets really annoying.
Emma Mulholland	2	November 14, 2020	It's glitchy but it's my favorite game Because it's voodoo

Mark Mann	5	November 14, 2020	Hard but fun
Joshuah - 2000 -	4	November 14, 2020	You make a lot of games, impressive! The only issue with your games is, while they are fun to play at first, people tend to loose interest in them quickly, uninstall, and go searching for something else instead. I lost interest after about the 4th level into this game. It's just the same old same old. There's nothing new. Take your time! When was the last time you actually put your heart and soul into one game that players will love? You guys can do better, I know you can. Best of luck! - Josh
Happy Khambh	5	November 14, 2020	I like this game
Nova gacha	4	November 14, 2020	ITS AWESOME
Ashley Pedersen	1	November 14, 2020	Terrible company that churn out games and but ridiculous amount of ads in them. Every match, which lasts 20 seconds, is followed by an ad. Don't download VOODOO games. It's just not worth it
Javon Wright	4	November 14, 2020	Fun
Audrey Devin	1	November 14, 2020	This game is the worst he I've ever had I definitely don't recommend it if you get it you will hate it

Rico Micky	1	November 14, 2020	I wouldn't have even toutched this game if you couldn't play offline without ads. Even without ads, very bad controls and lag make it unplayable.

Candido Rojas	1	November 14, 2020	I hate this game it's like one of those games that they put the least effort in it . Super cheap imposible to win never install This game you will regret it. & it makes me want to throw up🤢🤮
riarkle_always	1	November 14, 2020	The controls are set up hard to function so I end up losing for no reason
jomar614 loticio	5	November 14, 2020	dis game is buetiful
Gustaf Sand	3	November 14, 2020	Good concept, but way too many ads. One after every game played. And doesn't seem like I'm playing online, which isn't fun.
Google Account	1	November 14, 2020	This game has the absolute worst ad ever. Like god damn stop showing it to me.

Ronit Jobanputra	4	November 14, 2020	The product's idea is pretty good and it has been fairly goodly developed. However, the game kinda does lag and there is an ad after each and every level which is kind of irritating but I liked the concept of the game. Voodoo please work a bit more on your game. :)
Jimmy Winkelmann	1	November 14, 2020	Way too easy played about 20 rounds and never lost
