As you can see a generic response from the Developer's, I don't think that they fully understand the damage the last update caused us all, when I was finally able to log in I had been slaughtered by other players, and had lost everything.

The new company that has taken over have absolutely destroyed the game! now the game is full of bugs and glitches! It's a horrible experience to play. The customer service is now also dreadful!

It take like a day to fully regenerate the stamina and that is too long. 2) Add more commander. The current commander does not enough to to fully command a five army camp troops. 3)Make the troops coupons easier to get. It actually kinda hard to get a new troop. Overall the game is really fun to play. Can't wait to what new update will bring."

This is highly offensive as Soviet Russia was occupant of Poland as much as Nazis. Polish militia with polish flag armband would fight both soviets and nazis. Even after war when Soviets occupied Poland there was resistance against Soviet oppression and communist puppet state they have installed. For Poland WW2 really finished in 1989 and in 1993 the last soviet troops left."

Second, sometimes the buttons dont work even though the game isnt frozen. Third, the alliance system needs to be better in every way.

    "Really good game. It's still really new, so there are plenty of details and small things that can be improved. For one, it would be nice to be able to view other's bases from their profile. This game uses energy to collect resources that you can use to improve your base. Upgrading takes no time, which is very nice, but the energy recharges slowly. 30hrs to fully replenish you 150 pool, which can get you 15 resources from enemies found on the map. Other small things I can't put, but good game."

    "The concept is brilliant and could work amazingly, I found the graphics impressive for a mobile game and I loved the attention to detail from some of the historical character types. However I really struggled to enjoy playing it as to me the narrative at times felt forced, and some of the voice acting didn't feel natural. However if it wasn't for the unfortunately unimpresive voice acting, and some of the filler missions, the game would be a solid 5 stars."

    "This is a compelling game with good graphics and some interesting mechanics. I think its a genuine effort by the developer to make a less p2w game that is still fun to play and social. There is obviously still some development work ongoing but I'm excited to see what features are added in future updates. I think its a little unfair to post 1 star reviews if you're having trouble accessing the game."

We could relive one of the great things the whole world was part of. And please dont say the nazi flag is meaningless. Because if it were, u wouldnt have went out of ur way to sterilize the game--despite the fact that its HALF the story of the struggle of ww2. Who is it ur trying to not offend? Ill redownload it when u guys get some perspective.\""

Fortifications besides the bunker I would love soilders to build small defences that reduce damage 3. A mini base what I was thinking you could set it up anywhere it can be attacked by raven and players and there should be 2 barracks on it like a camp basicly but it has to be expensive in game resources so new players don't go all willie nillie with it"

Please, if you are going to make a game like Minecraft, change at least a few things that are obvious so that it does not appear as an off brand Minecraft. I would say though, if you did add some changes in graphics, and maybe different things. I would rate 4 at least by then."

My first impression based on the games play store page was that it was gonna be some 2d shooter with minecraft screenshots as the background but it was actually a fully fledged blocky shooting game. Probably uses some stolen game engine tbh."

In conclusion it sucks I can't give it zero stars and people who say this is good are either stupid or worked on the game just spend six dollars to get the real game."

During the manicure there are ads that pop up, and after each person you give a manicure to there is an ad. Also the process of giving the manicure is really hard because the tools (paint brushes and the drill) don't line up with your finger. I 100% recomend that you DO NOT DOWNLOAD this app!

Way to many adverts to even enjoy the game properly! In the space of one client I had 3 adverts then another 2 after I done the nails so it is rather had to enjoy after getting interrupted by adverts! Graphics is great. But unfortunately due to the above I'm having to uninstall the game as I can't enjoy."

    "I admit it feels like those cheap games with as little effort as possible, and I'm subtly creeped out by the silence, but I have to give it to them, this one's actually unique. Premise is simple, yet actually challenging in a way I'd like to see polished by someone more capable. Control is slightly rough, perhaps if turning was based on where you touch, instead of based on the gesture you make, it would be smoother, devs. It has the common issue of too many ads but that's par for this dev."
