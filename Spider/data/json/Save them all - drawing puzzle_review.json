But more rooms are needed. This is not a very good game compared to other games. But it is a good game. We need more rooms and people to improve it. If you are reading this, please be sure to fix the problem I mentioned in the next update. Everyone loves all your games. I like it too. That's why I said this. Thank you.\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d"

I mean there is only one bedroom,one bathroom and one floor just another attic.The attic is also too small and less scary then I expected.I hope this house could be larger and attic can be a lot more scary.Other ways I would suggest this game\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42"

For your first 10x summon you get the same worst ssr hero over and over, tried on 5 different phones, 2nd 10x no ssr. No currency to buy card/shard, useless packs upto 100$. U decide"

    "The game is Cute. At the beginning I thought it wasP2W because most of the summoning fields was with real money but I kept playing cause the game story made me laugh a bit. And I collected the pre register rewards and summoned like15times I got like 2SSR and 4SR and this is only the first day so the truth need to be said this game is fair and dose not oppres F2P Players and with the pre register and the first event it is like no difference between the both.the story rewards you alot of cards too"

More of a problem for the cannon as i can not see where the bullets are going and thus fail the event every time because of that you get 3 stars max as this leads me to believe there may be more events like this and my progross will become hindered.

Add quest removal and decline options for all non story mode quests. 3. Pay to win is seperate from free player pvp. 4. Social media integration should be optional not forced. 5. Make your pricing fair not greedy, VIP 10$ a month and non pvp attire for aesthetic appeal only at 10$ per costume. Then it's a perfect as a game can be. Now why is that so hard huh?"

At least give us a 3 hour time-frame minimum. Second, you can not do auto repeat for certain challenges. This is also ridiculous and inconsiderate of the players time. If they fix these two issues, I doubt this game will die and it will be super fun. If they don't, expect a shutdown in the next 6 months"

No one wants to repeat the same actions in a game every 50 levels! Not worth downloading or if you do delete after you have to start over at level 51! In my opinion the devs need to add more different things and choices to the game or stop scamming people 4.99 to get rid of ads if you repeat stuff."

Your options are reduced to human male warrior, human female wizard, kindred male assassin, kindred male vampire, elf female cleric, elf male ranger, dwarf female marksman. No elf bard, no stoneman protector. And to top it all, the number of 5 star fake ratings really weakens this game's standing."

I think this game is just like another promising games! Its a total SCAM! I wish everyone that gives highest rating comeback and rewrite their feedback. This is a total waste of effort and time!! You deserve negative one or zero star ratings!!!"

Im giving 5 \u2b50 until i believe differently. Hopefully the adds are true, id hate for this to be like all other games. Id live to be able to refer my mom and dusabled friends to play for money on the side. So far i have no complaints besides those adds in games but i expected them."

But again everytjing else is pretty good for a mobile game."

Then once it goes to an ad it sits there buffering trying to load. Then after the ad finishes the game freezes and all you can do is exit and start over again. Can the developer try to address these issues?"

Phone gets hot while playing it within just a few games so I can never collect all the tasks for the day. I'm tired of fighting with it so I am uninstalling."

    "Way better than other home designer apps in that the animations are smooth and transitions fairly seamless. Would love to see some more of the Steam House Flipper options integrated here in future updates, like adding/removing walls and outside options. My main issue, and the reason this does not get 5 stars, is the REQUIRED use of premium currency to fulfil orders. I don't have an issue with using premium currency to unlock things to put in the houses we flip - that's a personal choice. However, to be forced to use my premium currency to complete a customer's order is ridiculous, especially since you don't earn any of it back when the order is completed. And the forced wait to earn the money after completing an order is also annoying - I'd be happy to watch an ad to speed things up, but it is an insult after you've spent time completing an order to then be forced to wait to receive the money you have earned. Far too many transactions that require premium currency, this needs to rebalanced."

Also, when you buy, upgrade/furnish, and sell houses, they don't seem to make any profit after you account for upgrade/furnishing cost. This basically means you can't play the game after running out of flipper coins. I hope these get fixed :("

If you're searching for a good, fun mobile game, then i think you'll love this. They have simple controls, amazing gameplay, and smooth graphics. Of course, this doesn't compare to the PC version. And expect some mechanics where you have to spend some money in order to skip the progression."

Graphic are decent and combat is decent , yes you can auto combat but someone of the same gear doing manual will beat you, Cash shop isnt the wrost i saw after 40 game of this genra but they need to reduce the ammount of advantage from paying . And please dont say genshin impact is the best , Genshin have a lot of problems related to gaisha and content , graphic style and gameplay is fully different so you cannot compare both."

If I wanted that I'd watch a movie instead of playing a game. In response to the developers comment. I said too much auto play. Only turning off auto battle doesn't eliminate the boredom of auto play as I watch my character run around doing everything with no imput from me."

Quests run themselves, your character moves themselves, and really, you dont have to do anything. The NPC placement is laughable (they just stand in a very convenient path), and generally, the game itself is pretty boring. Especially combat.

    "The game has AUTO PLAY on everything, you can just leave it to play itself. There questing ends at level 59, which you reach in about 40-50 minutes of playing and after that the next level requires you o be level 60, but you can't reach it as you have done all your events for the day. Your last resort is to grind mobs that could take at least 9 hours to get the required XP to reach level 60. I don't know what happens in the game after that. There are zones that look like the old zones from the PC Forsaken World, but they require you to be level 100 in order to travel there. The game has almost zero gameplay or things to do aside from leaving AUTO PLAY to play the game for you and occasionally to collect rewards or enhance your gear. It feels more boring than playing FarmVille. The game is an absolute letdown."

First i couldnt even play at full graphics due to the game telling me my device cant handle it when i can i can play dragon raja real engine 4 on full settings no problem. 2nd its a forced auto quest and combat. 3rd the movement is just trash hands down.4th you can tell there was just little effort in making a polished game and just rushed to get in the market to make money. This will be auto p2w. This game is forsaken."

Combat is far too boring to want to manual. Various systems and features are barely explained. UI is cluttered. Voice acting is horrible. Hot take: just another cash grab social MMO that takes no skill or effort and inflates e-peens everywhere into thinking you rock for spending money on this tripe."

Multiple languages were being spoken at once. Decent graphics, though because it was just released, I had to turn down my setting"

You choose new temporary weapons in pvp for no reason, making your class choice pointless. Auto play but not in pvp which is very cool. Graphics are fantastic. I only play pvp games I was really excited but this pvp is clunky (stand and cast) and boring. May be P2W later idk."

I've been looking at the screen for full 5 minutes, watching my character, do quests on its own. If that's entertaining to you, then go ahead and install. But on the flipside, the character creation is diverse, so there's that. No body editing though, just the face, so it's quite lacking."

The problem is the energy system and the many ways you are gated from PLAYING which is the whole point of a game.

    "This game has elements to make it stand above the competition, borrowing heavily from BDO and D3 and offering PvE/PvP without forcing you to take either role too heavily. The constant switching between open and instanced worlds makes freezes/crashes during loads a common occurrence, not to mention endless cut scenes to explain a story most players likely skip through. Once devs add an auto skip option and allow inventory access during instances, this game will evolve into something bigger."

And when I finally do is disconnects every 30 seconds. I can't do anything! Let alone a quest. In all regards biggest disappointment for a mobile game I've had ever.

Gets stuck if you run into a tutorial. Your soul linker (companion) who fights along side you does double and sometimes triple the damage over you. Manually targeting is not good. Camera is the worst I've seen. PvE is boring. Battle royale mode is fun for a bit."

CONS: Difficulty accessing some of the controls on the UI for smaller screens/ networking and connectivity issues (I am assuming the emergency maintenance is to address these issues). This is one of the better games with the auto-play feature (makes quests easier while punishing players during pvp, raids and events). Will update once I hit endgame."

Im not a fan of auto pilot or combat in mmorpgs, but in this game i kinda understand why it has so its ok. Second, please dont make A3 like Lineage2R(heavy pay2win). And third, when combat happen, fps drop really bad(55fps-34fps). Please fix it. Thats all for now. Thanks Netmarble."

You just jump from one quest to another without any sense of achievement. There are like a million weapons and armour drops which are just pointless to have, you just sell them when your inventory is full.

Satisfied with the gaming experience! \ud83d\udc4c P.S To those people who complain about auto mode function. Then dont use the function. But I appreciate the auto mode function, why? Imaginge killing 100+ mobs for quest doing it manually? You out of your mind? Haha. Again, thanks for the auto function!"

I wish the customization was more vast, including the option to choose gender. The graphics could also be further improved. I also wish this game wasn't all about auto-gaming. I would much rather control the battles and adventures myself. This game needs some work, and since it's still relatively new, they have time to improve this game ."

This is a PHENOMENAL game with extremely deep mechanics, tons of dungeons, group and guild content, and more. Yes, there's an auto battle focus, but it's the best auto battle I've ever seen with the ability to micromanage skill order and auto combo order.

Overall the game is amazing and the only complaint I have is that you should add auto tracking/auto camera turns to the enemies when you're not playing in auto. Its very hard for classes like the Hunter class to hit their targets sometimes. Anyways if you can do that this game will be perfect. Thank you so much."

The new company that has taken over have absolutely destroyed the game! now the game is full of bugs and glitches! It's a horrible experience to play. The customer service is now also dreadful!

It take like a day to fully regenerate the stamina and that is too long. 2) Add more commander. The current commander does not enough to to fully command a five army camp troops. 3)Make the troops coupons easier to get. It actually kinda hard to get a new troop.

Overall, the game is great. Excellent graphics, all characters are animated, an interesting plot. Beautiful mysterious video inserts. Even buildings, vehicles and weapons change their appearance with every upgrade! And there are interesting real historical facts about all weapons and vehicles presented there. Love it 5*"

    "The game is very good and definitely held up to my expectations. The graphics are pretty good, story is interesting, and game play is very good. As unlike other RTS games like this you can actually move units around and not have to go back to base after every battle. But if I had any gripes about the game, it would be the glitch if you spend gold to speed up your research to buy speed ups. It takes all your gold jo mater how much your have nor how much the speed up costed."

Second, sometimes the buttons dont work even though the game isnt frozen. Third, the alliance system needs to be better in every way.

    "Really good game. It's still really new, so there are plenty of details and small things that can be improved. For one, it would be nice to be able to view other's bases from their profile. This game uses energy to collect resources that you can use to improve your base. Upgrading takes no time, which is very nice, but the energy recharges slowly. 30hrs to fully replenish you 150 pool, which can get you 15 resources from enemies found on the map. Other small things I can't put, but good game."

However I really struggled to enjoy playing it as to me the narrative at times felt forced, and some of the voice acting didn't feel natural. However if it wasn't for the unfortunately unimpresive voice acting, and some of the filler missions, the game would be a solid 5 stars."

There is obviously still some development work ongoing but I'm excited to see what features are added in future updates. I think its a little unfair to post 1 star reviews if you're having trouble accessing the game."

We could relive one of the great things the whole world was part of. And please dont say the nazi flag is meaningless. Because if it were, u wouldnt have went out of ur way to sterilize the game--despite the fact that its HALF the story of the struggle of ww2. Who is it ur trying to not offend?

A mini base what I was thinking you could set it up anywhere it can be attacked by raven and players and there should be 2 barracks on it like a camp basicly but it has to be expensive in game resources so new players don't go all willie nillie with it"

Please, if you are going to make a game like Minecraft, change at least a few things that are obvious so that it does not appear as an off brand Minecraft. I would say though, if you did add some changes in graphics, and maybe different things. I would rate 4 at least by then."

My first impression based on the games play store page was that it was gonna be some 2d shooter with minecraft screenshots as the background but it was actually a fully fledged blocky shooting game. Probably uses some stolen game engine tbh."

I got an ad after finishing the first hand, another ad in the middle of the second hand, then another advertisement at the end of the third hand. Excessive advertisements kill your app, and actually make you lose money, because people will Uninstall it. UPDATE: Got another ad immediately after placing the bead on the 4th hand. The game is fun, but Ive Uninstalled it."

It's a fun game, but I wish there were more options for customization. Also I found out that this app is able to add photos to your camera roll without permission. Which makes me wonder what else they have access to without asking for permission. Like I said before, makes me uneasy about reinstalling this app. Downloader beware."

Really I don't even know about 3d molting but I could still make something better. Next the maps are HORRIBLE it's the same thing but reskined. There is a ad for every other breath you take and there is NOTHING that says we DON'T care about the game only the money then well... THE WHOLE GAME."

Control is slightly rough, perhaps if turning was based on where you touch, instead of based on the gesture you make, it would be smoother, devs. It has the common issue of too many ads but that's par for this dev."

All though the animations look hard worked that's made an extra star. But then we have the ads which are like 30 seconds and you can finish a level in about 20 seconds.

If you choose to not watch the ad and just continue you still get a 30 second ad... Your better off taking the extra coins since you have to watch it anyway. would be a regular game of mine if the development team wasn't so greedy and just made use want to get the extra coins for skins or to unlock a course"

I lost interest after about the 4th level into this game. It's just the same old same old. There's nothing new. Take your time!
