Literally after every round you have to sit through a minimum of a 5 second ad, and most of the time you have to manually skip the ad or sit there for 30 seconds. There is no need for this level of frequency and just proves that this was written purely as a cash-grab rather than a genuine game."

Some of them are :- 1)Pay to win - This probably is the biggest problem right now in the game. 2)Glitches and Bugs - Please fix it. 3)Ping Problem - People are losing their rank due to this. 4)Matchmaking - It seriously takes a lot of time if you have higher rank.

Everything feels really solid and easy to understand, rather than being overwhelmed with things that are just slapped on for good measure, and the soul linker system is really cool with the fact that they have activatable skills and what not. The BR mode is fun also. It is a bit grindy, but it's not as bad as some other games. Overall, I enjoy it a lot."

The constant switching between open and instanced worlds makes freezes/crashes during loads a common occurrence, not to mention endless cut scenes to explain a story most players likely skip through. Once devs add an auto skip option and allow inventory access during instances, this game will evolve into something bigger."

You cant expect players to be immersed in you game if it has auto play. Its just that games like this are meant to be PLAYED. Auto play is the worst thing to ever happen with mobile games. Even worse than unnecesaary microtransactions."

And when I finally do is disconnects every 30 seconds. I can't do anything! Let alone a quest. In all regards biggest disappointment for a mobile game I've had ever.

Gets stuck if you run into a tutorial. Your soul linker (companion) who fights along side you does double and sometimes triple the damage over you. Manually targeting is not good. Camera is the worst I've seen. PvE is boring. Battle royale mode is fun for a bit."

CONS: Difficulty accessing some of the controls on the UI for smaller screens/ networking and connectivity issues (I am assuming the emergency maintenance is to address these issues). This is one of the better games with the auto-play feature (makes quests easier while punishing players during pvp, raids and events). Will update once I hit endgame."

You just jump from one quest to another without any sense of achievement. There are like a million weapons and armour drops which are just pointless to have, you just sell them when your inventory is full. The audio is in a different league of sadness, the dialogues are having incomplete audio and the worst is when you are in combat."

All you have to do is play, grind for it. Like any other game. You can have fun and be a f2p player too. Stop being lazy and enjoy the game \ud83c\udfae."

Normally i turn off backround data anyway but forgot after installing new games. The auto battle is still fun and lets you target and pick attacks. The side quests and games are fun as well and the graphics are still beautiful on medium setting."

Create a character is impressive visually but the limited selection is weak. The automission feature and town made it seem like a cheap average mobile mmorpg, none of which have ever been worth playing. Incredibly disappointed, the idea had so much potential and they had the budget. Epic fail."

The dungeons are boring and quick, no real loot? How can game designers not look at WoW and make a similar game... this is just a copy of V4 and many others. Wouldnt recommend."

    "It's pretty useless to put shadow/wetness on the same setting as textures quality at least seperate it...the shadow setting only set the resolution of it while lowering textures quality actually turn the shadow off and the environmental texture wetness is ugly and cause fps too fall and phone heating up. If you want a beautiful game set it to high or ultra but be ready for your phone to melt. setting it to medium and I got 27fps even on 6gb ram phone, high 40fps and 47 degrees, good job"

I also love the resting rewards you get when you are not playing as well. I have not spent a single dime on it and thats a good thing. Its an awesome game, and I'm looking forward to reaching max level on all classes. Keep it up!"

I've been stuck fighting that swamp dragon for 2 days now The exp required to level means ive gotta go out for like 3 more days and farm afk if I wanted this id still be playing g afk arena. And for a game that wants to use a party system u made the story mode single player FIX THIS WE WANT TO QUEST WITH OUR FRIENDS"

Haven't paid money to get things like you with other games like this. You can get enough gold by looking for it once the fog clears. I've gotten like 12k gold and heaps of rss. I can't put the game down its really addictive. But there some issues. Like, there could be a separate folder in chat column for alliance members. Another for others. Thanks."

Sometime im confused where is heavy tank and medium tank when war, so please add like a colour belom trooper. Like army 1 is grean mark, army 2 is yellow mark. So its will be more easy to move the troop to perfect spot. Anyway the graphic and perfomenced are 10/10. And last thing, please add zoom out/in button. Thank you \ud83d\ude01."

The controls on this game is understandable but sometimes it just gets confusing I understand the controls and sometimes not. Another thing is launguage. I understand there is a translator but some people don't use it or even know what's it for.But anyways the game is great. Graphics are good and so is the gameplay and all I see is women as officers like I know they have rights too but it's kinda weird.Either way good game."

This game uses energy to collect resources that you can use to improve your base. Upgrading takes no time, which is very nice, but the energy recharges slowly. 30hrs to fully replenish you 150 pool, which can get you 15 resources from enemies found on the map. Other small things I can't put, but good game."

However if it wasn't for the unfortunately unimpresive voice acting, and some of the filler missions, the game would be a solid 5 stars."

Here is a couple things in the game that need to be fixed and or changed please. #1 the disassembly of tanks and artillery please make it so u can do everything not just 3 star and below I want to get rid of a few vehicles that are 4 and 5 star but the game doesnt allow u to disassemble them into scrap and parts like u can with 3 star and below and it sucks lol..#2 unfriending someone u can add friends but u cant get rid of them and it doesn't make sense"

For instance it takes over a whole day for your energy to fully replenish,(I believe it is 1 day and 5 hours) that's a little ridiculous. But the character designs, the graphics, the weapons, the story are all on point. You guys just need to shorten the time it takes to replenish energy."

The campaign is great but the difficulty rises to fast, outpacing the player, forcing them to either grind extensively or pay. Grinding by all means isn't bad but when the grind wall is so high then obviously it will annoy people. Last thing is the energy recovery should be faster or energy completely removed.

Also, the gameplay is quite repetitive in some areas, and I can't play for more than an hour without getting bored and doing something else."

The developers were very generous this is not a pay to win game. What we really need is more players. We have a good chunk of people but it's spread across all languages so it's not a very multiplayer experience until we get more people. At least for those of us who only speak one language. Maybe install a translator for the city chat."

Probably uses some stolen game engine tbh."

It's got an amazing storyline, awesome 3D graphics, giant boss fights, PVP battles, and hundreds of never before seen champions to collect and customize. I never expected to get this level of performance out of a mobile game. Look how crazy the level of detail is on these champions!"

It would be nice if it let the play do most of the work. I go around the cuticle area and I cant even go down the nail with it completely finishing for me and with the polishing. That kinda took the fun out of it. Other than that its a good game.. but its too too easy."

During the manicure there are ads that pop up, and after each person you give a manicure to there is an ad. Also the process of giving the manicure is really hard because the tools (paint brushes and the drill) don't line up with your finger. I 100% recomend that you DO NOT DOWNLOAD this app!

Way to many adverts to even enjoy the game properly! In the space of one client I had 3 adverts then another 2 after I done the nails so it is rather had to enjoy after getting interrupted by adverts! Graphics is great. But unfortunately due to the above I'm having to uninstall the game as I can't enjoy."

Control is slightly rough, perhaps if turning was based on where you touch, instead of based on the gesture you make, it would be smoother, devs. It has the common issue of too many ads but that's par for this dev."
