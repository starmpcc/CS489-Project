During the manicure there are ads that pop up, and after each person you give a manicure to there is an ad. Also the process of giving the manicure is really hard because the tools (paint brushes and the drill) don't line up with your finger. I 100% recomend that you DO NOT DOWNLOAD this app!

Way to many adverts to even enjoy the game properly! In the space of one client I had 3 adverts then another 2 after I done the nails so it is rather had to enjoy after getting interrupted by adverts! Graphics is great. But unfortunately due to the above I'm having to uninstall the game as I can't enjoy."

    "Fun game, but not many options, and it's too automated. I'm giving it 1 star because of the ADS. Absolutely ridiculous amount of ads. I couldn't even get through ONE client without at least 2 ads. Uninstalled. Will not recommend this game to anyone unless the ads are fixed. Sad when the developers care more about money than the actual game. You'd make more if you actually had a decent game, less ads, and more purchase options. Wish I could give negative stars."

The only issue with your games is, while they are fun to play at first, people tend to loose interest in them quickly, uninstall, and go searching for something else instead. I lost interest after about the 4th level into this game. It's just the same old same old. There's nothing new. Take your time! When was the last time you actually put your heart and soul into one game that players will love? You guys can do better, I know you can. Best of luck! - Josh"
